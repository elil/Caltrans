1:38		toward becoming a member of California's	
1:40		professional land surveying community	
1:45		hello my name is Bill Jackson I am	
1:48		associate land surveyor for department	
1:50		water resources in Sacramento I want to	
1:52		welcome you to unit 6 of the Cal Trans	
1:54		video training course Cara Liang and I	
1:57		will be presenting this video unit on	
1:59		leveling we will be introducing the	
2:01		basic concepts equipment and methods	
2:03		used in leveling this course will serve	
2:06		to introduce leveling to those of you	
2:08		who have not had much experience running	
2:10		levels and for those of you who are well	
2:12		experienced in leveling it will serve to	
2:14		reinforce what you are already familiar	
2:16		with and help guide you into those areas	
2:18		that might need additional study for	
2:20		taking the l SI t & LS exams hi i'm	
2:27		carol young and i - i'm an associate	
2:29		land surveyor with the department of	
2:31		water resources and i want to welcome	
2:33		you to this video on leveling leveling	
2:37		the surveying procedure of vertical	
2:39		measurements the measurement of	
2:41		differences in elevation the first thing	
2:45		in learning any subject requires an	
2:47		understanding of the basics knowing the	
2:49		definitions of the terms used our first	
2:52		topic we will be discussing is the basic	
2:55		concepts of leveling the basic concepts	
2:58		of leveling are detailed in the	
3:00		following in a	
3:01		illustration from your workbook the	
3:05		first concept is datum to measure any	
3:08		distance you must start from a selected	
3:10		reference plane data or surface with a	
3:13		known or assumed elevation this is	
3:17		usually mean sea level based on 1929	
3:20		information the next one is level line a	
3:24		line that is parallel with the selected	
3:27		data since dadums are based on	
3:29		measurements of a curved earth's surface	
3:31		the level line is curved also vertical	
3:36		line a line that follows the center of	
3:39		gravity plumb-bob line at the point of	
3:42		observation next is horizontal line a	
3:46		line that is perpendicular to the	
3:49		vertical line passing through the point	
3:51		of observation an important concept to	
3:55		remember is that a level line and a	
3:57		horizontal line are not the same a level	
4:00		line is curved parallel to the datum and	
4:03		the horizontal line is straight at right	
4:06		angles to the vertical line at the point	
4:09		of observation next is elevation it is	
4:14		the vertical position above or below the	
4:17		selected datum next is benchmark that is	
4:22		a permanently fixed point with a known	
4:26		elevation and last ortho metric	
4:30		correction because the earth is not a	
4:32		perfect sphere the effects of gravity	
4:36		and centrifugal force vary somewhat at	
4:39		higher elevations	
4:41		this variation must be corrected on long	
4:44		level runs made in a generally	
4:47		north-south direction at higher	
4:50		elevations a discussion in this	
4:53		correction is given in chapter 5 of the	
4:55		Caltrans manual you should make a point	
4:58		of familiarizing yourself with the	
5:00		concept of ortho metric correction it	
5:03		was part of a question in a recent LS	
5:05		exam the ortho metric correction is just	
5:08		one of several Corrections you should	
5:10		know here's Bill to explain the need	
5:14		for for correcting curvature and	
5:16		refraction thanks Carol for your	
5:21		explanation two basic concepts of	
5:22		leveling as Carol pointed out a level	
5:26		line is parallel with a reference datum	
5:28		the level line is curved and follows a	
5:30		curvature of the reference datum	
5:32		deviating from the horizontal sight line	
5:34		because of this deviation from the	
5:36		horizontal a curvature correction must	
5:39		be considered on long level sightings as	
5:42		can be seen in the illustration the	
5:44		greater the length of the sighting the	
5:45		more the level line deviates from the	
5:47		horizontal line the more the two lines	
5:50		depart from one another the greater the	
5:52		curvature correction will be another	
5:55		correction that must be considered along	
5:56		with curvature is refraction when light	
5:59		passes through the atmosphere events	
6:02		slightly causing an object to appear	
6:04		higher than its actual location again in	
6:07		the illustration we can see the actual	
6:08		line of sight is lower than the	
6:10		horizontal line by the difference	
6:12		labeled R this difference is a	
6:14		refraction correction because both	
6:17		curvature and refraction effect	
6:19		sightings at the same time the two	
6:22		Corrections can be combined the	
6:24		compliant combined effect of curvature	
6:26		and refraction is calculated by the	
6:28		formula C plus R equals zero point zero	
6:32		two one K squared C is equal to the	
6:36		curvature correction R equals the wrote	
6:39		refraction correction and K is the	
6:41		distance in thousands of feet squared an	
6:43		example for K would be that if you the	
6:46		level line was 2,000 feet long then K	
6:49		would be 2 squared or equal to 4	
6:52		applying this correction to various	
6:54		sighting distances we can calculate the	
6:57		combined effects of curvature and	
6:58		refraction the table in your workbook	
7:01		shows correction values for various	
7:03		distances	
7:03		it is interesting to note that a sight	
7:06		distance of 700 feet results and only	
7:09		one hundredth correction and elevation	
7:11		level sighting would have to be longer	
7:14		than 500 feet before an actual	
7:15		correction for curvature and refraction	
7:17		would be a major consideration in	
7:19		elevation calculations it can be seen	
7:23		from the table that the relationship	
7:24		between curvature and refraction and	
7:26		sight distance is not	
7:27		direct ratio because the formula for	
7:30		curvature and refraction is exponential	
7:32		the correction for curvature and	
7:34		refraction increases exponentially not	
7:37		proportionally as a side distances	
7:39		increases	
7:40		although curvature and refraction must	
7:42		be considered for accurate level work	
7:44		the effects of curvature and refraction	
7:47		can be eliminated the most common method	
7:49		used to eliminate the effects of	
7:51		curvature refraction is to balance the	
7:53		length of the four sites and back sites	
7:55		for each sighting example if we took the	
7:59		00-foot site distance from the table	
8:01		the correction for curvature and	
8:03		refraction would be minus 0.01	
8:06		hundredths of a foot for our back sight	
8:09		the curvature and refraction correction	
8:11		would lower the back sight rod reading	
8:13		by one hundredth of a foot if we took a	
8:15		foresight Reno an equal 700 feet away	
8:19		the correction for curves should excuse	
8:22		me the correction for curvature	
8:23		refraction whether it would then be the	
8:25		same minus 0.01 hundredths of a foot as	
8:29		a back sight the foresight rod reading	
8:32		would also be lowered by the same 0.01	
8:35		hundreds of a foot thus canceling the	
8:37		effect of the curvature refraction on	
8:39		the setup we will discuss this method of	
8:41		leveling in more detail shortly	
8:43		now Carol will introduce the three	
8:46		methods of vertical measurement leveling	
8:47		would be we'll be covering the three	
8:52		leveling methods we will be covering our	
8:55		direct vertical measurement leveling	
8:58		trigonometric leveling and differential	
9:01		leveling the first topic direct vertical	
9:06		measurement leveling is according to the	
9:10		Caltrans manual chapter five direct	
9:13		vertical measurement is the direct	
9:15		reading of elevations or vertical	
9:17		distances values are not mathematically	
9:20		manipulated except to apply Corrections	
9:23		and adjustments another direct method to	
9:27		be discussed is altimeter e is also	
9:30		known as barometric leveling it uses	
9:34		altimeters that display the elevation	
9:36		based on the variation in app	
9:39		farik pressures at different altitudes	
9:42		because the atmospheric pressure varies	
9:45		daily the use of altimeter II for other	
9:48		than very rough approximations is not	
9:51		encouraged useful for preliminary	
9:54		surveys then we have direct elevation	
9:57		rods with the use of a pendulum level	
0:00		and special rods known as linker rods	
0:03		elevations can be read directly on	
0:05		selected points this is a common method	
0:08		used in construction surveying this	
0:11		method is also good for determining	
0:13		elevations in moderate terrain but is	
0:16		not accurate enough for control at work	
0:18		bill would demonstrate the use of a link	
0:21		arrived this is a linker rod as curl	
0:26		referred to it a direct reading rod the	
0:30		interesting thing about this rod is that	
0:32		it's two-part construction and has a	
0:33		wood section in the front that slides	
0:35		over the back section and in the front	
0:37		section has a tape that rotates around	
0:42		the porcelain	
0:43		now this tape is 10 feet long and the	
0:47		interesting thing about this tape is	
0:48		that instead of reading 0 at the X and	
0:52		then going 1 2 3 4 and feet it starts 0	
0:55		at the X and it goes 1 2 3 feet	
0:58		downwards so the tape is backwards now	
1:01		what this does it facilitates setting an	
1:03		elevation in the rod so when the	
1:05		instrument sets up and reads the	
1:08		elevation on this rod set on the bench	
1:10		mark the instrument man can tell the rod	
1:13		person what the elevation is thus say	
1:15		for example that the rod reading is 9	
1:19		09 feet and in 1/10 so and the line of	
1:23		sight was down here this tape would be	
1:26		rotated to read 9 1 0 right here on this	
1:30		tape and once that is read and it can be	
1:34		locked in position with this little lock	
1:38		on the side of the rod when that is	
1:41		locked in position now when the front	
1:43		portion moves	
1:44		the tape doesn't move so that elevation	
1:48		is always locked into the rod at that	
1:50		point so when you pick the rod up and	
1:52		you move it to another position and set	
1:54		it down even though it might not be at	
1:56		the same elevation as the benchmark you	
1:58		can then directly read the elevation on	
2:01		the rod for example if you took the rod	
2:04		and you set it on a point that was	
2:05		higher than the original benchmark that	
2:07		would raise the rod which means that the	
2:09		elevation should be higher so if the	
2:12		land site wasn't at nine one zero here	
2:14		and you raised the rod which means that	
2:16		the elevation should be higher so if	
2:18		you're reading that's a half a foot	
2:19		higher then you would be reading at nine	
2:22		four I mean nine five Oh instead of the	
2:25		nine one that you started with and	
2:27		likewise if you set the rod on a point	
2:29		that was lower than the starting	
2:31		benchmark then the rod be further down	
2:33		from the line of sight and you would be	
2:35		reading higher which means that you	
2:37		would be reading the lower elevation and	
2:39		this is one example of a direct reading	
2:41		rod called a linker rod thanks Bill for	
2:46		that excellent explanation on the linker	
2:49		rod the next direct vertical measurement	
2:51		is lasers with the advent of laser	
2:54		technology it is possible to measure	
2:57		elevations with the use of lasers and	
2:59		special leveling rods with this method	
3:02		it is used frequently in construction	
3:05		projects and in agriculture to locate	
3:08		contours the next method is Global	
3:11		Positioning System GPS it does not	
3:15		measure elevations directly in relation	
3:18		to add atom with accuracies good enough	
3:20		for survey work the system measures	
3:23		ellipsoid heights very accurately and	
3:25		can be used to measure relative	
3:27		differences in the elevation of points	
3:29		with elevation with known elevations or	
3:32		otherwise in the past there have been	
3:35		very few questions on direct vertical	
3:37		measurement asked on the lsit exam and	
3:40		none on the LS exam but you should still	
3:43		be familiar with these especially with	
3:46		the concept of GPS it is likely that it	
3:49		will be used to form a question or	
3:51		answer for problems in future exams our	
3:56		second method a leveling is	
3:58		trignometric leveling this is an	
4:01		indirect vertical measurement method	
4:04		that determines the difference in	
4:06		elevation between two points by	
4:09		trigonometric means vertical differences	
4:12		in elevations are computed from slope	
4:14		distances vertical angle measurements	
4:17		and the instrument and prism heights the	
4:21		most common uses of trigonometric levels	
4:23		are determining elevations on distant	
4:27		remote points or where there is	
4:29		considerable differences in elevation	
4:32		between points topographic surveys where	
4:36		points are inaccessible by normal	
4:38		leveling methods such as crossing rivers	
4:40		and highways and it can be very useful	
4:43		for control surveys or small-scale photo	
4:46		control such as 1 inch equals 200 feet	
4:49		and it can also be used in place of	
4:52		differential leveling the most	
4:55		convenient method used today for	
4:56		trigonometric leveling is with the use	
4:59		of a total station and prism Paul but	
5:03		depending upon the accuracy required a	
5:05		polite Fiat alight and rod employing	
5:08		stadia can be used the following	
5:12		illustration details the basic concepts	
5:15		of trigonometric leveling a total	
5:17		station is referenced to a point of	
5:19		known elevation a benchmark such as	
5:23		point a in the illustration or it can be	
5:27		set up over a point with a previously	
5:29		determined elevation the total station	
5:32		is then sighted on a rod and prism at a	
5:36		remote point such as point B to	
5:40		calculate the elevation of the sighted	
5:42		point the vertical angle to the centre	
5:45		of the prism is read from the total	
5:48		station and the slope distance is	
5:50		measured knowing the height of the	
5:53		instrument and the height of the prism	
5:55		the elevation of point B can be	
5:59		calculated as an example a total station	
6:04		is set up at five point two five over a	
6:08		point with a known elevation of 100 feet	
6:12		the prism is set at 6.41 feet over a	
6:16		point where the elevation is to be	
6:18		determined the Zenith angle is measured	
6:21		at 86 degrees 49 minutes 29 seconds	
6:25		the Zenith angle is measured from 0	
6:30		degrees being directly overhead of the	
6:33		instrument the slope distance is	
6:35		measured at one thousand four hundred	
6:38		and eighty six point seven one feet	
6:42		what is the elevation of point B the	
6:46		elevation of B is equal to the elevation	
6:49		of a 100 feet plus the H I of the	
6:54		instrument five point two five feet plus	
6:58		the cosine of the zenith angle 86	
7:01		degrees 49 minutes 29 seconds times the	
7:05		slope distance of one thousand four	
7:08		hundred eighty six point seven one feet	
7:11		minus the H I of the prism 6.4 one feet	
7:15		and that minus the correction for	
7:18		curvature and refraction 0.02 one times	
7:24		one point four eight six squared to	
7:28		equal 180 one point one four feet four	
7:34		point B notice in this example the	
7:38		correction for curvature and refraction	
7:41		about minus 0.05 feet must be included	
7:46		with this type of leveling the balancing	
7:49		of forward and backward sightings or	
7:52		simultaneous trigonometric leveling will	
7:55		eliminate the need for correcting for	
7:58		curvature and refraction simultaneous	
8:01		trigonometric leveling is the same as	
8:04		the example given above except two	
8:07		instruments are used to shoot the	
8:09		distances and angles at the same time	
8:11		from both ends of the lines being dirt	
8:14		being determined this method of	
8:17		trigonometric leveling eliminates the	
8:19		problem of changing atmospheric	
8:22		conditions bill will now continue with	
8:25		our third method	
8:25		of vertical measurement leveling	
8:28		differential leveling a third method a	
8:33		vertical measurement leveling his	
8:35		differential leveling differential	
8:37		leveling is a process of measuring the	
8:39		differences the differentials in	
8:41		elevation between any two points by	
8:43		spirit leveling differential leveling is	
8:46		broken down into different levels of	
8:48		accuracies known as orders these orders	
8:51		are first second and third order and	
8:53		first and third excuse me the first and	
8:56		second ordered the orders are further	
8:58		broken down into class 1 & 2 the highest	
9:01		order of accuracy being first order	
9:03		class 1 and the least accurate being	
9:05		third order we will present a more	
9:08		detailed discussion of these accuracies	
9:09		later on the equipment used in	
9:12		differential leveling is in third order	
9:15		work pendulum type automatic levels	
9:17		these are automatic levels with glass	
9:19		prisms hung on wires to eliminate errors	
9:22		caused by miss leveling the instrument	
9:24		the illustration on the screen shows the	
9:27		internal construction of these levels if	
9:29		you notice in your illustration the	
9:32		shaded areas represent the glass prisms	
9:35		that are built into the level these	
9:38		glass prisms are all hung on wires so if	
9:41		the level is out of adjustment or out of	
9:44		level just a little bit when you sight	
9:46		through the level these prisms correct	
9:49		for that adjustment and level the the	
9:53		siding up so the level can be out of a	
9:57		adjustment or out of level just a little	
9:59		bit and you can still read accurately	
0:03		the rods used in third order work are	
0:06		generally Philadelphia type rods	
0:08		graduated in feet or single construction	
0:10		Dhiraj graduated in yards or meters	
0:13		carol has a zeiss level and a filly rod	
0:16		to show us now this is a zeiss ni 2	
0:21		level it is a typical pendulum level	
0:23		normally used with Philadelphia rods it	
0:26		has an eyepiece with an objective lens	
0:29		and focus an adjustment there are three	
0:31		level screws used in leveling the	
0:34		instrument there is a bubble level used	
0:36		to level the instrument more precisely	
0:39		the filly rod is a two-piece wooden rod	
0:42		with graduation marks and feet tints and	
0:45		hundreds unex tended it can be read to a	
0:48		height of 7 feet for Heights greater	
0:51		than 7 feet the additional section can	
0:53		be raised and clamped in place and first	
0:57		order work work the level is used a	
1:00		highly accurate micrometer type pin um	
1:03		levels such as a zeiss ni one and single	
1:07		construction in vari yard or meter rods	
1:10		Carroll has an ni one level and	
1:12		first-order rod to show us this is a	
1:16		zeiss ni one pin them level it looks and	
1:19		functions the same as a level that was	
1:21		previously shown with an exception there	
1:24		is an addition of a micrometer with an	
1:26		eyepiece the micrometer and eyepiece is	
1:29		an exhibit of ice to provide the	
1:31		measurement of very small increments	
1:35		with a first ordered level rod the	
1:37		increments can be read two to ten	
1:40		thousandth of a meter this is a	
1:43		first-order leveling rod also known as	
1:45		an involuntary	
1:47		this one is aluminum with an invert tape	
1:50		with graduation marks and meters	
1:52		invar is a metal alloy that resists	
1:54		resists expansion and contraction due to	
1:57		temperature fluctuations Springs are	
1:59		attached to maintain a constant tension	
2:01		instability the rod has a heart a heart	
2:04		of metal foot and sets up on a heavy	
2:06		metal boot once placed on the boot with	
2:09		the use of the bubble level attached to	
2:11		the back of the rod the legs adjust and	
2:13		clamp to maintain the rod on a stable	
2:15		vertical plane these rods are made and	
2:18		matched calibrated sets Thank You Carol	
2:23		for your help and demonstrating that	
2:24		equipment chapter 2 section 8 of the	
2:27		Caltrans manual gives a good detailed	
2:29		discussion of the equipment used in	
2:31		differential leveling the methods used	
2:34		in differential 11 are illustrated in	
2:37		your workbook and can be seen on the	
2:39		screen now the level is set up some	
2:42		distance from a benchmark and the	
2:44		direction the level run is to proceed a	
2:46		benchmark is a permanent point with a	
2:48		known elevation such as B ma the rod is	
2:51		placed on the benchmark	
2:52		and a back sight reading is taken with	
2:54		the level this reading is added to the	
2:56		elevation of the benchmark which gives	
2:58		the elevation of the level in this case	
3:00		00 feet plus ten point six three feet	
3:03		equals the height than the instrument or	
3:05		10 point six three feet the rod is in	
3:09		moved forward if possible an equal	
3:11		distance to the back side and placed on	
3:13		an intermediate turning point this level	
3:15		is turned the level is turned and a	
3:18		reading is taken again on the rod at the	
3:20		foresight turning point this foresight	
3:22		reading is then subtracted from the H I	
3:24		of the instrument to give the elevation	
3:26		of the turning point in our example this	
3:29		would be 110 point six three feet minus	
3:32		one point one five feet equals an	
3:35		elevation of 109 point forty eight feet	
3:38		for the new point the level is then	
3:41		moved ahead and set up at some	
3:43		convenient point the distance from the	
3:45		rod to the new set of point the back	
3:47		sight distance should equal the distance	
3:49		to the next point ahead where the rod	
3:51		would be placed that is the next	
3:53		foresight turning point after the	
3:55		instrument is set up and leveled a back	
3:57		sight reading is then taken on the rod	
3:59		at the previous turning point this	
4:01		backside reading is then added to the	
4:03		elevation of the turning point the sum	
4:05		of the back sight reading and the	
4:07		elevation of the turning point gives a	
4:09		new hi4 the level at the new setup and	
4:12		our example this would be one hundred	
4:15		nine point four eight feet the elevation	
4:18		of the turning point plus nine point	
4:20		nine two the reading on the rod at the	
4:22		turning point equals one hundred	
4:24		nineteen point four zero feet the	
4:26		elevation of the level at the new setup	
4:28		point this process is then repeated	
4:31		until the level run is tied into a point	
4:34		of known elevation or is looped back to	
4:36		N on the beginning benchmark closing the	
4:39		level run back on itself is called a	
4:41		closed loop level run closing the level	
4:43		run and a bit point of known elevate	
4:45		elevation other than the beginning	
4:47		benchmark is called an open level run it	
4:50		is open because it does not close back	
4:52		on the beginning point closing the level	
4:55		run gives a means by which the level run	
4:56		can be checked to determine any random	
4:58		errors in the run these errors can then	
5:01		be eliminated by several different	
5:02		methods we will be discussing later	
5:05		other aspect of differential leveling is	
5:07		profile leveling profile levels are	
5:10		basically the same as differential	
5:12		leveling except several for sites are	
5:14		taken on predetermined points before the	
5:16		level is moved ahead to the next setup	
5:18		for example if a differential level run	
5:21		was used to run along the centerline of	
5:24		a road to be constructed it would be	
5:26		necessary to determine the elevation	
5:27		along the centerline stations to	
5:30		calculate the cuts and fills for the new	
5:32		road this would be done by intermediate	
5:35		foresight readings on as many centerline	
5:37		stations as possible from one level set	
5:39		up without moving the level ahead these	
5:42		intermediate foresight readings would be	
5:44		subtracted from the H I of the level to	
5:46		give the elevation of each station along	
5:48		the road centerline an essential part of	
5:52		differential leveling is taking good	
5:54		understandable filled notes several	
5:56		methods have taken differential level	
5:58		notes are used in surveying different	
6:01		methods are used depending on what level	
6:02		of accuracy is desired and the	
6:04		procedures of your organization it is	
6:07		important to understand how level notes	
6:09		are written the computations made with	
6:11		level notes have appeared on several LS	
6:14		exams and lsit exams and one LS exam the	
6:18		applicants were actually required to	
6:20		reproduce notes in the test booklet to	
6:22		show they knew how to take and reduce	
6:26		level notes the fallen illustration	
6:29		demonstrates several methods used and	
6:31		taking fill notes our first example of	
6:34		level notes shows a differential profile	
6:36		level note using a philadelphia type	
6:38		foot rod notice the notes are taken	
6:41		going up the page taking notes going up	
6:45		the page simplifies retracing the level	
6:47		run in the field to interpret these	
6:49		notes start with the elevation four	
6:52		hundred and seven point five three five	
6:54		at the bottom right corner of the	
6:55		example the first plus shot or back	
6:59		sight reading is six point nine nine	
7:01		five this plus shot is added to the	
7:04		starting elevation of four hundred and	
7:06		seven point five three five to give us	
7:08		the elevation of the level or h i-- as	
7:11		for one four point five three zero the	
7:15		first four side of reading are - shot	
7:17		four point seven six five	
7:19		is then subtracted from the calculated	
7:21		elevation of the level of 414 point five	
7:24		three zero so for one four point five	
7:27		three zero minus the foresight of four	
7:30		point seven six five gives us the	
7:32		elevation of the turning point as four	
7:34		hundred nine point seven six five feet	
7:36		this procedure is repeated into the last	
7:39		elevation of four hundred twelve point	
7:42		zero zero five for the closing benches	
7:44		checked against the known elevation for	
7:46		the point of four 12.011 this comparison	
7:51		tells us the level one does not close on	
7:53		the known elevation for the benchmark by	
7:55		a difference of six thousandths of a	
7:58		foot this error is distributed	
8:00		throughout the level loop to close the	
8:02		elevation run on the bench with a	
8:03		difference of zero our next example of	
8:07		level notes illustrates differential	
8:10		level notes for three wild levels using	
8:12		a foot rod through three wire levels is	
8:15		a method used to obtain higher	
8:17		accuracies than normal differential	
8:19		level procedures in our example the	
8:22		first set of backsight readings	
8:23		represents the readings on the rod for	
8:25		the top middle and bottom cross areas of	
8:28		the level scope when citing the rod	
8:31		eight point two six six is the top	
8:35		crosshair reading eight point one zero	
8:38		five is a middle crosshair reading and	
8:40		seven point nine four zero is the bottom	
8:43		crosshair meaning the number one six one	
8:45		is the interval difference between the	
8:48		top and middle crosshairs so if you	
8:50		subtracted eight point one zero five the	
8:53		middle crosshair from the top crosshair	
8:55		of eight point two six six the	
8:56		difference is one sixty one the number	
8:59		65 is the interval difference between	
9:02		the middle and bottom crosshairs so if	
9:05		you subtracted seven point nine four	
9:06		zero the bottom crosshair from eight	
9:09		point one zero five the middle crosshair	
9:11		the number would be 165 the number eight	
9:16		point one zero three seven equals the	
9:18		mean of the three readings and is used	
9:21		as the plus shot or the backsight	
9:23		reading for your notes three two six is	
9:27		the sum of the two intervals one six one	
9:30		plus one six two five which	
9:32		the crosshairs this is needed this is	
9:35		added to the some of the next back sight	
9:37		interval the total for the second back	
9:39		side is in 759 as shown in the example	
9:42		in your workbook and three wild levels	
9:45		there is a maximum amount allowed for	
9:47		the difference between the top interval	
9:48		61 in our example and the bottom	
9:51		interval 165 the maximum allowance for	
9:54		the difference between the top interval	
9:56		and the bottom interval is determined by	
9:58		the standards of accuracy for vertical	
9:59		control a more detailed discussion of	
0:02		these standards will follow shortly in	
0:03		our example the difference between the	
0:06		top and bottom intervals is 161 minus	
0:09		65 or four thousandths of a foot for	
0:12		thousands is generally acceptable for a	
0:14		maximum difference in third order work	
0:16		but not for second-order levels the for	
0:19		cited readings for the the three crossed	
0:21		errors are treated the same way the mean	
0:24		of the 4sight is then subtracted from	
0:26		the instrument height just as in normal	
0:28		differential level runs if the level one	
0:31		closes back on the same benchmark it	
0:33		started from then the algebraic sum of	
0:35		the means for the backsights the plus	
0:37		shots and the sum of the means for the	
0:39		four sites the minus shots should totals	
0:42		ero for the level run to close if the	
0:45		level run closes on a different	
0:46		benchmark than the beginning bench then	
0:49		the differences between the sum of the	
0:50		backsights the plus dots and the sum of	
0:53		the four sides the my shots is	
0:54		algebraically added to the elevation at	
0:57		the beginning benchmark to determine the	
0:59		elevation of the ending benchmark the	
1:01		calculated elevation should be the same	
1:03		as the known elevation of the ending	
1:06		benchmark any miss closure in the closed	
1:09		loop run or the open loop run must be	
1:11		distributed throughout the level run we	
1:16		will be discussing adjusting level runs	
1:19		later another method for taking three	
1:21		while differential level notes is shown	
1:23		in your workbook using a meter rod in	
1:26		this example the notes are going down	
1:28		the page notice the three while level	
1:31		notes for a meter rod are taken just	
1:33		like they were for the foot rod the	
1:35		reference on the notes to the back of	
1:37		the rod means a foot graduation tape on	
1:39		the back of the rod is shot as a check	
1:42		on the readings for the front of the rod	
1:44		knowing that one meter is equal to three	
1:47		point two eight zero eight three feet in	
1:50		our example we can easily see that two	
1:52		point three six five zero meters is then	
1:55		seven point seven six feet from this	
1:58		check on the back of the rod we know the	
2:00		mean for the readings on the front of	
2:02		the rod two point three six five zero	
2:04		meters has been made without error we	
2:09		have given you a few examples of	
2:11		acceptable level notes you may find in	
2:13		your professional surveying career that	
2:15		some surveyors prefer to take level	
2:17		notes differently than what we have	
2:18		presented it is not uncommon to see	
2:22		different methods of taking filled notes	
2:23		the important factor to remember in	
2:26		taking field notes is that they must be	
2:27		legible accurate and understandable and	
2:31		fully detail exactly what you did in	
2:34		your field work presented the different	
2:37		methods of recording level notes ends	
2:39		our discussion on the basic concepts of	
2:41		leveling we presented the three methods	
2:43		of leveling direct vertical measurement	
2:46		trigonometric leveling and differential	
2:50		leveling these three methods are used	
2:52		throughout the surveying profession to	
2:55		round out our understanding of leveling	
2:57		there are a couple of special leveling	
2:59		concepts that need to be understood the	
3:03		first special concept we need to	
3:05		understand is pegging a level Carolee	
3:08		explain how this is accomplished before	
3:12		any type of level run is attempted it is	
3:15		important that the level be in a proper	
3:17		adjustment the method commonly used to	
3:20		adjust a pendulum type level is called	
3:23		pegging a level here is an illustration	
3:27		showing one method used in pegging a	
3:29		level the level is set up at point one	
3:33		midway between two points approximately	
3:36		00 feet apart by setting the instrument	
3:40		midway between two points we can balance	
3:43		the backside and foresight eliminating	
3:46		instrument error for the back sight	
3:49		reading the rod can be set on a point of	
3:52		known or assumed elevation in our	
3:55		example the backsight point is	
3:57		a with the level at point one the	
4:01		backsight reading BS one is taken on the	
4:05		rod at Point a this backside is added to	
4:09		the elevation of point a to give the	
4:12		height of the instrument at point one	
4:15		the level is turned and the foresight	
4:18		reading FS one is taken on the rod at	
4:21		point B this foresight is subtracted	
4:25		from the level elevation to give the	
4:27		elevation of point B the level is then	
4:31		moved and set up at point two a short	
4:35		distance from the backsight point a the	
4:38		second set up should be where the	
4:39		backsight point a and the foresight	
4:41		point B can be observed with minimal	
4:44		turning of the level by setting the	
4:47		level of short distance from a the	
4:49		foresight and back sight are	
4:51		intentionally unbalanced the unbalanced	
4:55		sight distances will exaggerate any	
4:57		error in the mechanical workings of the	
5:00		instrument another back sight reading BS	
5:04		 is taken on the rod at point a the	
5:08		point nearest the level this gives a new	
5:11		elevation for the instrument height at	
5:13		setup point to another for sight reading	
5:17		FS 2 is then taken on the rod at point B	
5:21		this foresight rod reading establishes a	
5:24		new elevation for point B we now have	
5:28		two elevations for the same point any	
5:31		difference in the two elevations is the	
5:34		result of misalignment of the instrument	
5:37		crosshairs this mechanical error must be	
5:40		adjusted out of the instrument by	
5:42		actually moving the crosshairs in that	
5:45		the level scope up or down to make the	
5:48		foresight FS to yield the same elevation	
5:52		for point B s FS 1 thus eliminating the	
5:57		error as an example the following	
6:01		illustration details the computations	
6:04		used in pegging a level assuming an	
6:07		elevation of 100 feet for point a	
6:11		with a back sight reading of 5.10 feet	
6:14		makes the H I 105 point one zero feet	
6:19		reading a foresight of four point nine	
6:22		six feet and subtracting that from the H	
6:25		I gives an elevation of 100 point one	
6:28		four feet four point B after moving the	
6:32		level the new back sight reading is five	
6:34		point five one feet with an H eye of 105	
6:39		point five one feet then subtracting the	
6:42		foresight reading of five point three	
6:44		five feet the elevation of point B is	
6:48		00 point one six feet note that there	
6:53		is a difference of two one hundredths of	
6:55		a foot when comparing the two elevations	
6:58		for point B this error is a result of	
7:02		the crosshairs in the level being	
7:04		misaligned the error of plus point zero	
7:09		two must now be removed from the level	
7:12		by mechanically moving the level	
7:14		crosshairs up two hundredths to read	
7:17		five point three seven on the rod the	
7:21		new reading on the rod will yield the	
7:23		correct elevation for point B after the	
7:27		level has been adjusted it is strongly	
7:29		recommended that the peg test be run a	
7:31		second time as a check on the adjustment	
7:34		another correction that should be	
7:36		considered in the adjustment of pendulum	
7:38		type levels is the culmination error the	
7:42		culmination error is the slight variance	
7:45		that exists between the center line of	
7:48		the level scope and the actual center	
7:51		line of the crosshairs that cannot be	
7:53		eliminated by adjustment if this error	
7:56		is known for a particular level it	
7:59		should be considered and corrected on	
8:01		higher order level runs a good	
8:04		discussion of the culmination error is	
8:06		given in chapter 5 section 3 of the	
8:09		Caltrans manual and taking your LS or	
8:12		lsit exam you should be aware of the	
8:15		culmination correction it has appeared	
8:18		on previous LS and lsit exams now bill	
8:22		will tell us another special level	
8:24		procedure your workbook shows a general	
8:28		method used to accurately transfer	
8:31		elevations across rivers canyons and	
8:33		similar obstacles but when the	
8:35		backsights and for sites and a level run	
8:37		cannot be balanced	
8:38		this method is reciprocal leveling the	
8:41		illustration shows the obstacles to be	
8:43		crossed is a river the obstacle could	
8:46		also be a freeway or a canyon reciprocal	
8:49		levels can also be used to transfer	
8:51		elevation between floors and high-rise	
8:53		buildings in our example the level is	
8:56		set up at point number one a back sight	
8:59		is taken on the rod placed on BM number	
9:01		one if foresight is then taken on the	
9:04		rod placed on BM to the difference in	
9:07		elevation between BM number one and BM	
9:09		number two is determined by differential	
9:11		leveling it is customary to take several	
9:15		back sight and foresight readings at	
9:17		setup number one and averaging the shots	
9:19		there's also recommend to use two rods	
9:22		two rods when a BM number one and one @	
9:26		BM number two will eliminate any delay	
9:29		and move in a single rod atmospheric	
9:31		conditions could change during the time	
9:33		it might take to transfer one rod from	
9:35		the first benchmark across the obstacle	
9:37		to the second benchmark atmospheric	
9:40		changes do affect instruments and rod	
9:42		readings the level then is transported	
9:46		across the obstacle to setup number two	
9:48		that backside is then taken on BM number	
9:51		one the level is rotated and a foresight	
9:54		is taken on the rod at BM number two	
9:56		again it is preferable to take several	
9:59		shots and average them	
0:00		now you have two differences in	
0:02		elevations taken from two different	
0:04		setups the average of the two	
0:06		differences in elevations is determined	
0:08		and used to determine the elevation for	
0:10		BM number two another area of leveling	
0:14		that has been tested on past LS and lsit	
0:17		exams is the classification of accuracy	
0:20		standards and adjustments for vertical	
0:22		control the table in your workbook shows	
0:25		the classification accuracies for	
0:27		vertical control the table specifies	
0:30		minimal observation methods maximum	
0:33		maximum sight distances maximum number	
0:36		of setups	
0:37		and the maximum allowable miss closures	
0:39		for first second and third order levels	
0:41		the close reading of the tables reveals	
0:44		a lot of specific information that	
0:46		should be considered before determining	
0:48		the accuracy required for a level run	
0:50		for example the requirements for a	
0:53		second order class to level one are a	
0:56		minimum of three while levels with a	
0:58		closing error no greater than eight	
1:00		times the square root of D millimeters D	
1:04		equals the shortest length of a section	
1:06		one way in three while level runs and	
1:09		kilometers and remember a kilometer is	
1:12		three thousand two hundred eighty point	
1:14		eight three feet and there are three	
1:17		hundred and four point eight zero	
1:18		millimeters per foot if a level run is	
1:22		three thousand two hundred eighty point	
1:24		eight three feet or one kilometer long	
1:26		in one direction the maximum is closure	
1:29		allowed would then be eight millimeters	
1:31		or zero point zero to six feet if the	
1:36		closure is greater than zero point zero	
1:38		to six feet it would not qualify for	
1:40		second order class tomb if you wanted to	
1:43		run levels to qualify for first order	
1:45		class tube you would have to use a first	
1:48		order level with a micrometer readings	
1:50		as we demonstrated earlier and only have	
1:54		a miss closure of 0.01 three feet or	
1:58		thirteen thousand cell a foot in three	
2:01		thousand two hundred and eighty point	
2:03		eight three feet or in one kilometer it	
2:05		is very important that you familiarize	
2:07		yourself with these standards and how to	
2:10		apply them to specific level runs you	
2:13		should plan on study in this area	
2:14		further by using any of the resources in	
2:17		the bibliography at the end of the	
2:18		chapter in your workbook after the	
2:23		accuracy standards have been determined	
2:24		and applied it finally comes down to	
2:27		what do you do with the error in your	
2:28		level runs there are three methods of	
2:31		adjustments that are generally used to	
2:33		adjust level runs these methods are	
2:36		length of line method number of turning	
2:40		points method and least squares method	
2:44		here we have an example of a level run	
2:48		this level run has four legs of various	
2:50		lengths the closing error is plus 0.05	
2:55		feet to distribute the error of this run	
2:58		the elevation for each of the 40 beams	
3:01		would be adjusted down to make the run	
3:04		close flat on BMB this adjustment can be	
3:08		done by one of the three methods in the	
3:11		length align method each leg would be	
3:14		adjusted based on the ratio of each leg	
3:16		to the total length of the run four leg	
3:20		one of the run the adjustment would be	
3:22		00 feet is to 2,000 feet as the	
3:26		adjustment is to 0.05 feet or the error	
3:30		of the total run in this case that	
3:32		correction is minus 0.0075 feet or about	
3:37		one hundredths of a foot the elevation	
3:41		of TB number one TBM number one would be	
3:43		lowered by this amount each of the	
3:46		subsequent legs would then also be	
3:48		adjusted similarly accumulating the	
3:50		adjustment through the remaining turning	
3:52		points the last leg would get the full	
3:55		correction of 0.05 feet to close a leg	
3:59		flat on the ending benchmark to	
4:03		distribute the same era by the number of	
4:05		turning points method the error is	
4:08		evenly distributed among the turning	
4:09		points in this example we'd have the	
4:12		error of five hundredths of a foot	
4:14		divided by four equals minus 0.01 to	
4:20		five feet per turn turning point number	
4:25		one of our example would then be	
4:26		adjusted by 0.01 to five feet turning	
4:31		point number two would be minus 0.025	
4:35		feet and turning point number three	
4:37		would be minus 0.375 feet and so on	
4:41		through the remaining turns to close	
4:43		flat on the benchmark and the least	
4:46		squares of method adjusting lever ones	
4:48		by least squares adjustment is beyond	
4:50		the scope of this presentation we	
4:52		encourage you to study this method in	
4:54		the surveying handbook by minikin	
4:56		Brinker reference at the end of the	
4:58		chapter in the workbook	
5:02		Carol and I have covered the basic	
5:04		concepts methods and Corrections for the	
5:06		three main areas of leveling we are we

5:11		level accuracy standards and adjustment
