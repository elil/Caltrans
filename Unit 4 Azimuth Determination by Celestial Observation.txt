0:49		welcome to Caltrans lsi TLS exam	
0:52		preparation course one aid in your	
0:56		preparation for California licensure	
0:58		examinations or word of caution don't	
1:01		use this course as your only preparation	
1:04		devise and follow a regular schedule of	
1:07		study which begins months before the	
1:09		test what many problems in each area not	
1:14		just those in this courses workbook but	
1:17		problems from other sources as well this	
1:20		course is funded by Caltrans but you and	
1:24		I owe a profound thanks to others the	
1:27		courses instructors from the academic	
1:29		community the private sector other	
1:32		public agencies and from Caltrans as	
1:35		well we wish you well in your study	
1:38		toward becoming a member of California's	
1:40		professional land surveying community hi	
1:46		welcome to the world of astronomy	
1:48		well maybe not astronomy may be better	
1:50		said welcome to the world of astronomic	
1:53		azmuth determination astronomy as the	
1:55		subjects like that big and we're only	
1:57		going to talk about maybe that much of	
1:59		it only that part that applies to the	
2:01		land surveyors examination and what you	
2:03		need to know to answer a problem in	
2:05		astronomy the purpose of this video is	
2:11		to help you answer an astronomy problem	
2:14		in the land surveyors examination and	
2:16		all that we're going to talk about is	
2:19		going to be structured toward that end	
2:24		one thing you want to remember that in	
2:26		the examination it is not the	
2:28		examination that your enemy it's the	
2:29		clock the examination is an open book	
2:32		examination and if you had all the time	
2:34		in the world and you got an open book	
2:36		let's hate you would pass the test right	
2:38		and the test once you pass it you're	
2:40		going to have your license to survey so	
2:42		the test is your dear friend it's that	
2:44		clock that your enemy but you are	
2:50		limited so again we're going to	
2:52		structure how we deal with the lands	
2:55		there's a land surveyors examination and	
2:57		how are we working astronomy problem	
2:59		doing that	
3:01		now my name is Jack Sands by the way	
3:04		Jack's the nickname for John and I'm	
3:07		going to be your tour guide for this	
3:09		video now I work in the San Diego County	
3:12		surveyor's office in the Department of	
3:14		Public Works now in this video we're	
3:17		going to cover the pzs triangle we're	
3:20		going to talk about how the the Sun the	
3:23		earth and the stars in Iraq we're gonna	
3:25		talk about latitude longitude Greenwich	
3:27		our angled declination local our angle	
3:30		these are all the things that you need	
3:32		to work the PCs triangle we're going to	
3:37		be doing this using graphics and also a	
3:40		three-dimensional model now the	
3:42		three-dimensional model is going to help	
3:44		you a little better understand this	
3:46		interaction of the earth and the Sun	
3:48		where sometimes graphics just doesn't	
3:50		quite get it done and then we're going	
3:55		to take a recent land surveyors	
3:56		examination and we're going to go	
3:58		through it step by step so you'll see	
4:00		just how an astronomy problem can be	
4:02		worked as we move through the video	
4:09		we'll be naming the describing various	
4:12		terms that are associated with astronomy	
4:14		you're going to find these terms in your	
4:17		workbook in unit 4 and that unit is	
4:21		titled as azimuth determination by	
4:24		celestial observation so let's take a	
4:29		look at a PCS triangle the vzs triangle	
4:34		is a spherical triangle and in a	
4:36		spherical triangle the parts the three	
4:39		sides the three angles are all measured	
4:42		in degrees minutes and seconds now the	
4:44		pzs takes its name from the letters	
4:46		assigned to the three corners that's P	
4:48		for Pole	
4:49		Z stands for zenith and the S stands for	
4:52		Sun or star the Beast the PCs triangle	
4:56		can have many shapes it's dependent on	
4:58		where Z is and where s is now P is the	
5:01		North Pole it stays where it is if it	
5:02		doesn't stay where it is and we got a	
5:04		problem a whole lot bigger than this	
5:06		land surveyors examination and that'd be	
5:08		a whole nother ballgame but it stays	
5:10		where it is it's the pole and Z and s	
5:12		move and that's what changes the	
5:14		shape the PCs triangle that you see is a	
5:22		morning observation with the Z the	
5:24		observer somewhere in California you	
5:27		know it's gonna be a California land	
5:28		surveyors examination so that's why	
5:29		California and the S the Sun is	
5:32		somewhere in the morning because it's	
5:35		coming up it hasn't got to our meridian	
5:37		yet the pzs triangle shown here is on	
5:43		the Earth's surface the pzs triangle	
5:46		used to compute the azimuth is on the	
5:48		celestial sphere the celestial sphere is	
5:51		a sphere of infinite radius with its	
5:53		center at the Earth's center it's north	
5:55		it's South Pole at the extension of the	
5:58		Earth's North South Pole and its equator	
6:00		an extension of the earth's equator the	
6:02		Sun and the stars are all presumed to be	
6:04		on the surface of this globe regardless	
6:06		of their distance we will show the pzs	
6:10		triangle on the earth for the sake of	
6:14		understanding a little better its	
6:15		relationship to the earth let's take the	
6:19		display showing the pzs triangle and	
6:21		build it one step at a time all the	
6:26		lines of latitude and longitude need a	
6:29		starting place in origin for latitudes	
6:32		we use the equator and for longitudes we	
6:34		use the line of longitude that runs	
6:36		through Greenwich England latitudes are	
6:38		measured north or south from the equator	
6:40		and the longitudes are measured either	
6:42		east or west from Greenwich the reason	
6:45		we use Greenwich the greatest meridian	
6:47		as the zero meridian is because hey the	
6:50		English were here first they wrote the	
6:52		book you think they're going to put in	
6:54		Ireland no sir	
6:57		now let's add a line of latitude and a	
6:59		line of longitude at Z remember that the	
7:02		location of the observer is at Z and	
7:05		next we're going to add the line of	
7:07		latitude and longitude at s that's where	
7:10		the line from the Sun to the center of	
7:12		the earth touches the Earth's surface	
7:16		now when we're talking latitude and	
7:19		longitude for the Sun we don't call it	
7:22		latitude and longitude we call it	
7:25		declination and we call it	
7:27		in each our angle but it's still a	
7:29		measure declination of latitude and the	
7:31		Greenwich our angle a measure of	
7:33		longitude now we can put in the legs of	
7:39		our pzs triangle P down to Z P down to s	
7:43		and Z over to s and now with a little	
7:47		magic we can make our triangle shine 8tv	
7:51		wonderful now let's add the symbol for	
7:57		west longitude and the symbol for	
7:59		latitude the angle of longitude measured	
8:02		west from the Greenwich Meridian to the	
8:04		longitude of the observer is called west	
8:07		longitude the symbol for longitude is	
8:10		the Greek letter lambda just think of a	
8:13		girafft going west the angle measured	
8:17		north or south from the equator to the	
8:19		latitude of the observer is called fee	
8:23		spelled pH I that's a little circle with	
8:27		a line through it next we're going to	
8:30		put in GH a declination and LH a the	
8:35		angle of longitude measured west from	
8:37		the Greenwich Meridian to the longitude	
8:39		of the son of the star is called	
8:40		Greenwich our angle the angle measured	
8:44		north or south from the equator is	
8:52		called declination the angle of	
9:00		longitude measured west from the	
9:02		longitude of the observer that's all the	
9:05		way around West on our picture to the	
9:08		Sun is called local our angle and the	
9:10		key here is the first word when we're	
9:13		talking from Greenwich around to the	
9:15		longitude of this Sun in this case	
9:18		that's Greenwich our angle when we're	
9:20		going from the zenith or the local the	
9:22		place of the observation we go around	
9:25		west locals the key that's local our	
9:27		angle now all that's left to do is	
9:33		identify the parts of the triangle let's	
9:36		start with the angles the angle P	
9:41		I should say the angle at P is called	
9:43		little T that small letter T and it's	
9:46		related to LH a whenever LH a is more or	
9:50		less than 180 degrees is how T relates	
9:54		you can see that in our picture LH a is	
9:58		very large because it goes all the way	
9:59		around and what's left is T so you can	
0:01		see the two together make 360 degrees	
0:03		now this is a morning observation if	
0:06		this were an afternoon observation then	
0:09		you could see that the local R Aang	
0:11		would be rather small and the T and it	
0:14		would be the same thing so now you can	
0:16		see how the key to t is LH a when LH a	
0:20		is 180 degrees or less T is the same	
0:24		thing when LH a is greater than hundred	
0:26		eighty degrees then to get T we subtract	
0:29		LH a from 360 but the nice thing about	
0:33		it is is you don't have to worry about	
0:34		that at all	
0:35		because we just don't use T anymore just	
0:38		know that it's there and that's why we	
0:40		identify it at that part of the triangle	
0:41		all of our equations now just use LH a	
0:44		the azimuth angle that's the azimuth	
0:47		that's the angle we're after so it can	
0:50		be observed but in this situation	
0:52		because we're talking about the land	
0:54		surveyors examination allow that that's	
0:57		the angle that we're after computing and	
0:59		then the other one the one at where the	
1:01		Sun is that's called the Peres lactic	
1:02		angle now why the Peres lactic angle why	
1:04		do we call it that hey you got to call	
1:06		it something as stated earlier the sides	
1:11		of the triangle are measured in degrees	
1:13		the side from P to Z is ninety minus the	
1:16		latitude Cole at a-- tude Coast stands	
1:19		for complimentary angle the side from P	
1:22		to s is ninety minus the declination	
1:24		code declination again complimentary	
1:26		angle the side from Z to s is related to	
1:29		the vertical angle it can be determined	
1:31		by measuring the vertical angle to the	
1:33		Sun star or it can be computed from the	
1:36		time the letter H is used to identify	
1:38		this side sometimes referred to as the	
1:41		altitude the site itself is 90 minus H	
1:44		KO H again ko or student Lee	
1:47		complementary angle and there you have	
1:50		it the pzs triangle with all of its	
1:53		supporting information	
1:55		now that we have developed the PGS	
1:57		triangle let's find out how its get	
1:59		started let's take a three-dimensional	
2:02		model that we have which is going to	
2:04		help us a little better understand this	
2:06		and just show how we can get that pzs	
2:08		triangle here is our three-dimensional	
2:15		model this is the earth this is the Sun	
2:19		now contrary to what you've been told	
2:21		the Sun is not this big fiery ball in	
2:24		the sky that we go around we do go	
2:26		around it but it's just what you see I	
2:28		mean when you look up and you see the	
2:29		Sun it's a little round ball that's what	
2:30		you've got a little round ball Sun I lie	
2:33		but for the sake of the	
2:35		three-dimensional model this is what we	
2:37		have to have now another thing that	
2:39		we're going to do here is we're going to	
2:40		I would like to say pretend we're God	
2:43		but the caltrans people say I can't do	
2:45		that on the video so we're going to be	
2:47		astronauts and an astronaut we're going	
2:51		to be up in the above our solar system	
2:53		as an astronaut looking down with the	
2:55		idea of what is our perspective looking	
2:58		down as our astronauts as we as	
3:01		astronauts are doing everything is	
3:04		counterclockwise the Sun may even turn	
3:07		counterclockwise we turn	
3:09		counterclockwise we revolve around the	
3:14		Sun counterclockwise this is one year	
3:19		that you're looking at one complete	
3:20		revolution of the earth going around the	
3:22		Sun so think of it Oh everything	
3:26		clockwise we turn clockwise we go around	
3:28		the Sun clockwise the Sun may even turn	
3:30		clockwise now what you're looking at	
3:32		right now is the sun shining on the top	
3:35		part of the earth the northern	
3:38		hemisphere that would be our summer here	
3:40		in California right now because an	
3:44		engine you also see that the pitch of	
3:45		the earth has maintained itself that's a	
3:47		pitch of about 23 and 1/2 degrees and	
3:49		that stays that way even though	
3:52		returning you can see that that still	
3:53		stays at that pitch as we move around	
3:57		and get to this position you can see	
4:00		that the Sun will be shining directly at	
4:03		the equator and because we're going from	
4:05		summer toward winter that would be what	
4:07		we call the Achtung	
4:08		equinox our autumn equinox as we	
4:11		continue on for another three months and	
4:14		we get to where the sun is shining on	
4:17		the lower hemisphere that would be our	
4:19		winner that's what we'd call our winter	
4:21		solstice and then again on around to	
4:24		where as the Sun shines to the equator	
4:26		coming from winter to summer it would be	
4:29		the vernal equinox and then again one	
4:33		year later the sun shining on the	
4:34		northern hemisphere back to the summer	
4:37		solstice now we need to build a pzs	
4:41		triangle and where does it come from and	
4:43		how well first of all we're going to	
4:45		have a P P stands for North Pole Z	
4:53		stands for us where are we Cena through	
4:56		observer because again we're talking	
4:58		about the California Land Surveyors	
4:59		examination it's going to be in	
5:02		California so let's just say that right	
5:04		here is California and that's our Z now	
5:09		an S in the graphics display pzs	
5:14		triangle we saw how did that get started	
5:16		it started because we were doing our	
5:18		thing like this in the summertime and	
5:21		let's just first of all put in Greenwich	
5:24		remember we had to have a zero longitude	
5:26		well here's G for Greenwich let's say	
5:29		that Greenwich is right here now when	
5:33		the sun shining on Greenwich what isn't	
5:35		Greenwich	
5:35		right noon time and as we continue on	
5:40		eventually the Sun gets to our Zenith it	
5:43		would be what right it would be our noon	
5:46		time let's go back let's just say that	
5:49		it's noon at Greenwich and we're moving	
5:52		along and all of a sudden up we stop the	
5:54		earth now astronauts cannot stop the	
5:57		earth only God can stop the earth so now	
6:00		regardless of what Caltrans says we must	
6:02		pretend were God as God and stopping the	
6:05		earth when the Sun was shining directly	
6:07		on the earth toward the centre boom	
6:10		there was s and because we stopped it we	
6:14		created the three points of our pzs	
6:16		triangle P North Pole Z where we made	
6:19		our observation and s where we stopped	
6:21		the earth now	
6:22		actually this kept going but at the time	
6:24		we stopped it that's where they were and	
6:26		now you can see the pzs triangle let's	
6:29		just take a little piece of thread here	
6:30		and you can see the triangle very	
6:38		similar to the one in the graphics tzs	
6:41		triangle and that's how we got it now	
6:44		this can have many shapes the only	
6:47		reason that the shape is this way is	
6:48		because of where Z and where s are now	
6:51		because it's California land surveyors	
6:53		examination and that's what we're	
6:54		working on we're going to keep Z where	
6:57		it is and we're going to keep no we	
6:58		don't want to change P when that changes	
7:01		again you know we got a problem that's a	
7:03		whole lot bigger than this examination	
7:04		so P stays the same a Z stays the same	
7:06		but let's say that this was an afternoon	
7:09		observation let's say that you know here	
7:12		we were say at Greenwich moving along	
7:14		the Sun eventually past our Zenith and	
7:16		continued on until we stopped the earth	
7:20		again the line from the Sun right to the	
7:23		earth boom again we have a very similar	
7:26		triangle except that now P and Z of	
7:28		research reverse themselves here's our	
7:32		triangle again very similar looking	
7:35		again except as E and T or on the I	
7:38		should say s and z are on different	
7:40		sides let's say that it's a winner	
7:42		observation let's come around over here	
7:48		to where we would be in the winter and	
7:52		again remember looking down from the top	
7:55		everything is counterclockwise let's say	
7:59		as the Sun starts at Greenwich and it	
8:01		might be a morning observation again	
8:03		well we stopped the earth and aligned	
8:06		directly from the Sun to the earth would	
8:08		be where s is but now you can see we're	
8:12		going to have a very long elongated pzs	
8:16		triangle because now the Sun is below	
8:21		the equator that would be a minus	
8:23		declination remember when we talked	
8:25		about the latitude of the Sun or the	
8:27		star its declination it's not latitude	
8:30		so this would be a minus declination and	
8:32		one thing to be thinking about in that	
8:35		exam	
8:36		nation is one we're talking about	
8:37		declination they can be plus or minus in	
8:40		the alittle ephemeris book that you'll	
8:41		be probably having a copy of in the land	
8:43		surveyors examination the - will be	
8:46		shown the absence of - is a plus	
8:48		don't do that in the examination in the	
8:50		examination when it's plus you write	
8:52		down a plus when it's minus write down a	
8:54		minus and that way if it was - and you	
8:58		forgot to write it in and you just	
8:59		figure was a plus because of the absence	
9:01		of it good to get the wrong answer and	
9:03		there goes the question anyway you can	
9:06		see how the pzs triangle can have	
9:07		different shapes let's go back to the	
9:12		summer and so that we work with a	
9:19		triangle similar to the one in the	
9:20		graphics where we had Greenwich and we	
9:24		finally had a morning observation the	
9:26		Sun was directly shining to the Center	
9:28		of the Earth and our pzs triangle looked	
9:31		like this sort of one other thing I want	
9:41		you to remember or know about is there's	
9:44		a thing called Saudi riyal our angle our	
9:46		Saudi riyal time and what is severeal	
9:48		time versus solar time or civil time Sun	
9:52		time and that is this right here we are	
9:55		at our Zenith looking directly at the	
9:57		Sun the Stars work a little different in	
0:01		this regard and that the stars are all	
0:04		out here on the celestial sphere and if	
0:08		you'll see we have a star our star and	
0:12		our Sun are on direct line with each	
0:14		other and remember everything's	
0:16		counterclockwise now let's take one 24	
0:19		hour civil solar day and we'll just go	
0:23		around I'm going to exaggerate the	
0:24		movement here so that you can see what	
0:26		we're talking about here we are back to	
0:29		book I'm gonna stop and the zenith is	
0:32		looking right back at the star we've	
0:34		gone 360 degrees to the star but you can	
0:37		see we have yet to get back to the Sun a	
0:39		little bit more actually about four	
0:41		minutes and we're back to the Sun and	
0:43		there's 24 hours so you can see that	
0:47		measured in solar time	
0:48		the time on your clock civil time	
0:51		measured in that time a sidereal day is	
0:55		less it's 23 hours in approximately 56	
0:59		minutes the solar day 24 hours so you	
1:02		can see severeal time Sidora satiereal	
1:05		hour is a little bit less one other	
1:09		thing to be aware of is we can do and	
1:12		create a pzs triangle without ever	
1:15		making an observation with an instrument	
1:17		because all you have to have is a clock	
1:19		as soon as you say you stop the world	
1:22		there's your pzs triangle it's done but	
1:26		we don't we have an observation we have	
1:29		an observer we have a Zenith and at that	
1:31		exact time an instrument sighting the	
1:34		Sun stopped its motion no things went on	
1:38		but we had stopped it right here and at	
1:42		that time when we were observing the Sun	
1:45		let's allow that we took our instrument	
1:48		and looked to an observation like that	
1:51		now we have the pzs triangle from which	
1:55		we will later see how we can compute	
1:57		this azmuth angle and having measured an	
2:00		angle to some fixed point on the ground	
2:03		we can now add the azimuth angle to that	
2:06		angle and we can have an asthma Stu a	
2:08		fixed point that means we can pick our	
2:10		instrument up and go away and come back	
2:11		at some other time and use the azimuth	
2:14		established on that line so there you	
2:18		have it the pzs triangle where it comes	
2:22		from and how we do it now let's take	
2:25		what we've learned here and go back and	
2:28		apply it to a land surveyors examination	
2:31		problem we'll use the problem given in	
2:36		the 1989 California land surveyors	
2:39		examination it was a 20-point problem	
2:42		now ten points of this were for	
2:44		determining the latitude and longitude	
2:45		at station ruk and five points were for	
2:49		computing the azimuth from a line from a	
2:52		solar observation and then five points	
2:54		working for computing the angle of the	
2:56		closure we're going to deal with only	
2:58		that part that had to do with	
2:59		determining the azimuth from observing	
3:02		the Sun	
3:02		and we will the problem asked that we	
3:06		use either the our angle method or the	
3:08		altitude method and we're going to use	
3:10		the our angle method the equation for	
3:14		the our angle method in the equation for	
3:16		the altitude method are displayed on the	
3:17		screen they are also given in your	
3:19		workbook an important consideration at	
3:22		this point is which will take the longer	
3:24		the hour angle method or the altitude	
3:26		method remember time is the enemy in	
3:30		today's world of solar observation the	
3:32		hour angle method is preferred it is	
3:34		more accurate it is easier to observe	
3:37		because only the vertical end is	
3:38		observed but this ain't the real world	
3:41		this is the test and in the test its	
3:44		pass or fail and again times your enemy	
3:47		the altitude method in this problem will	
3:50		take less time because the hour angle	
3:54		method requires we compute LH a and	
3:56		declination the altitude method needs	
3:59		only the declination and that's one less	
4:02		thing to do the other component H and	
4:05		latitude the other components H and	
4:07		latitude are given if we had to correct	
4:11		H for refraction and parallax then it	
4:14		might be a trade-off you're going to	
4:16		have to decide which is going to take	
4:17		the least amount of time in this problem	
4:21		the altitude method would be the one to	
4:23		use because H is given corrected for	
4:25		refraction and parallax now after all of	
4:28		that why are we using the hour angle	
4:30		method so that you'll get an instruction	
4:32		in how to compute LH a the equation for	
4:37		the hour angle method requires that we	
4:39		know LH a of the Sun the declination of	
4:41		the Sun and the latitude of the observer	
4:44		so let's develop these items one at a	
4:46		time and then put them together into the	
4:49		equation to compute the LH a we need to	
4:53		know the time of the observation not	
4:56		just any time we need coordinated	
4:59		Universal Time UTC sometimes called	
5:02		Greenwich Time UTC is the is then	
5:05		corrected to get the base time on the	
5:09		actual rotation of the earth this	
5:11		correction is called D UT and the de UT	
5:14		correction is given in the problem the	
5:16		correction this corrected time we then	
5:19		call you t1 the reason we need u t1 is	
5:23		because the ephemeris data is for UTC so	
5:27		here we go	
5:28		to get LH a we first must convert the	
5:32		Pacific Daylight Standard Time	
5:34		excuse me saving Time Pacific daylight	
5:37		saving time to you t1 the display shows	
5:40		a way to deal with the information given	
5:43		to arrive at u t1	
5:48		the display shows a way to deal with the	
5:51		information most LS problems of this	
5:55		type can be answered in this style of	
5:59		format we list all the necessary	
6:01		information and then deal with it	
6:04		algebraically as a group it can be done	
6:06		each one by itself but it's probably a	
6:10		little better that we deal with it as a	
6:11		group first the time 5 23 35 now the	
6:18		reason we know this is p.m. because	
6:20		we're going to add a p.m. correction is	
6:21		because of the picture that you're going	
6:23		to have to look at in your workbook of	
6:25		the problem they didn't tell us this was	
6:27		p.m. now whether that's deliberate or	
6:29		not we don't know we do know that it's	
6:32		p.m. by just observing that the Sun was	
6:34		observed in the afternoon the PM	
6:36		correction 12 hours now the correction	
6:42		for timezone 7 hours y 7 hours trust me	
6:47		when it's specific daylight saving time	
6:50		you add 7 hours to get to UTC when a	
6:54		specific standard time you add 8 hours	
6:57		fortunes have been won and lost betting	
6:59		on whether you add or subtract spring	
7:01		back fall ahead I don't even remember	
7:04		the little jargons just allow that with	
7:07		this problem it's specific they like	
7:09		saving time and we're gonna add 7 hours	
7:13		next we put down the watch correction	
7:15		now when you've got a fast watch you	
7:18		subtract the correction this	
7:23		we subtract because the watch is fast	
7:27		why do we subtract the fast watch for	
7:31		the same reason that we add a slow watch	
7:34		because sans says so you can figure it	
7:37		out for yourself later right now let's	
7:39		just trust jack our last correction is	
7:43		the D UT correction this is given in the	
7:45		problem	
7:46		it's a minus 0.5 seconds this is the	
7:49		correction needed to change that UTC 2	
7:52		UT 1 now we will take the time of the	
7:55		observation 523 and add all these	
7:58		Corrections algebraically	
7:59		the result is UT 1 as you can see we	
8:03		have more than 24 hours at UT 1 24 23 34	
8:08		- and you can almost bet that any	
8:12		astronomy problem that you get of this	
8:15		type in the examination they're going to	
8:18		do this it's going to go over 24 hours	
8:19		because they want to know that you know	
8:21		what to do with it that you have to go	
8:23		into the next day when you're looking	
8:25		into the ephemeris information now we	
8:29		can compute GH a the ephemeris will give	
8:34		us the GH a for 0 hours on the day of	
8:37		observation we just we have just	
8:41		previously determined that the UT 1 of	
8:43		the observation we have just previously	
8:46		determined the UT 1 of observation the	
8:48		gh a of the observation is the gh a at 0	
8:51		hours plus the amount of GH a for the	
8:56		elapsed time from 0 hours to UT 1 to	
9:00		compute gh a for the elapsed time we	
9:02		need to first compute the total amount	
9:04		of GH a for the day of observation we do	
9:08		this by taking the difference between	
9:09		the gh a for zero hours today	
9:11		that's the 180 50:58 for and the GH a	
9:17		for zero hours tomorrow the 180 50 203 3	
9:21		and then we add 360 and the reason we	
9:25		have to add 360 is because there was a	
9:27		change in the elapsed time but it took a	
9:30		whole 24-hour period for it to happen	
9:32		and that's a 360 degree addition the	
9:36		result can be more or less depending on	
9:39		whether the GH a at the beginning of the	
9:42		day and the end of the day if he will	
9:45		the next day was more or less we then	
9:49		multiply this total GH a for the day by	
9:52		the UT 1 divided by 24 to get the gh a	
9:56		for the elapsed time if this all sounds	
0:00		very complicated well welcome to the	
0:02		club as you do it it will start to make	
0:05		sense each day must be considered	
0:07		separately because the total amount of	
0:09		GH a changes from day to day here we	
0:13		might want to talk a little bit about	
0:15		equation of time fortunately you don't	
0:17		have to worry about it anymore because	
0:19		all the ephemeris data is in G H a but	
0:23		the equation of time is that because the	
0:26		Sun does not travel excuse me the earth	
0:29		as it travels around the Sun does not	
0:30		travel at a constant speed it has a	
0:33		speeding up and a slowing down and this	
0:36		causes the real son of what they call	
0:38		the apparent Sun let's just talk about	
0:40		noon time at noon on our clock it may	
0:45		say noon but when you look up the Sun	
0:46		may not be right on the meridian it may	
0:48		be for maybe after because of the	
0:50		speeding up or slowing down and that's	
0:52		what the equation of time is all about	
0:54		it can be very confusing very	
0:55		complicated and again fortunately you	
0:58		don't have to worry about it because	
0:59		your ephemeris tables will take care of	
1:01		this for you	
1:02		the G H a corrects for that and with our	
1:06		problem adding all this up together	
1:09		the G H a for the elapsed time is 5 23	
1:12		4 1 and then we add this to the 0 hours	
1:15		and this gives us the G H a at the time	
1:18		of observation 186 44 32 5 now we can	
1:24		compute the LH a the formula LH a equals	
1:28		G H a - rest longitude you can find in	
1:31		your little ephemeris beach tables which	
1:34		is a real good little study text that	
1:37		also has the ephemeris in it 1 1946 54 5	
1:47		and now we've got the first part of our	
1:50		problem subtracting that we get LH a	
1:55		6-57 38 oh now let's do the declination	
2:05		computing the declination you're going	
2:07		to find is a lot similar to what we did	
2:09		when we computed gh a different numbers	
2:13		but generally the same procedure we take	
2:17		the difference between the declination	
2:18		for 0 hours today 1632 17:5 and the	
2:23		declination for 0 hours tomorrow 1648 59	
2:28		 multiplied this by you t1 divided by	
2:32		4 add the answer to the declination for	
2:35		 hours today	
2:36		sound familiar the declination for the	
2:39		time of observation ends up being 16 32	
2:43		3 9 as you can see the procedure is	
2:47		very similar to that for getting gh a	
2:51		one thing I might bring to your	
2:54		attention here is that there is a	
2:56		correction to the declination that this	
2:58		problem didn't address and it can be as	
3:03		much as 3 or 3.4 seconds the problem	
3:08		didn't ask for it so you're not going to	
3:09		have to worry about it	
3:10		but if it did give you a declination	
3:13		correction you would want to or they	
3:15		want you to attend to it you'll find	
3:17		there's an equation for this in your	
3:19		little again the little leads ephemeris	
3:21		tables because our UT 1 was so close to	
3:27		 hours the correction would be 0 this	
3:30		problem did not supply this correction	
3:32		and did not require it but it's a good	
3:34		thing to know about it the formula for	
3:36		computing this again is found in your	
3:38		little leads ephemeris handbook now the	
3:41		last of our three items that we need for	
3:43		this equation is the latitude and that's	
3:46		a given	
3:47		that's 36 48 57 if you'd work the first	
3:50		part of this problem that's where that	
3:51		would have come from but we're not	
3:52		dealing with that now let's take these	
3:56		three factors that we've been able to	
3:58		put together and let's put them into the	
4:00		equation and solve	
4:01		the equation shown on the screen is also	
4:03		given in your workbook in unit 4 this is	
4:06		the hour angle equation	
4:08		so go ahead work the equation you can	
4:11		stop the video while you work the	
4:12		equation well how did you do if you had	
4:20		to work the equation about six times to	
4:22		get the answer then your par for the	
4:24		course the good thing is that it isn't	
4:26		for the gold you're just practicing for	
4:29		the real thing	
4:30		you probably make dumb mistakes like you	
4:32		know two plus two is five you didn't	
4:35		change the say the degrees minutes and	
4:36		seconds to decimals of a degree most	
4:39		mistakes are because you're in a hurry	
4:40		and you will be on the exam remember	
4:43		time is your enemy there but the more	
4:46		you practice and the more and control	
4:49		you'll be you will be I know you're	
4:52		always hearing this the you know	
4:53		practice practice practice but it's true	
4:56		be prepared and you're gonna pass that	
4:58		test I can just about guarantee it	
5:02		the answer to our equation is - 89 47 48	
5:09		- when you have the answer to the	
5:15		equation you will need to do a	
5:16		normalization so that the result will	
5:21		reflect the asmath reckoned from north	
5:23		goes clockwise I guess for you that	
5:26		would be this way and it's positive in	
5:28		less than 360 use the box in the display	
5:32		to normalize the answer this box is also	
5:36		given in your workbook the LH a is	
5:40		between 0 and 180 and our problem and	
5:43		the answer to the equation was - that	
5:46		means that we have to add 360 and then	
5:49		that makes our answer the Asthma to the	
5:51		center of the Sun - seventy twelve	
5:54		eleven point eight however we did not	
5:59		cite the center of the Sun remember we	
6:01		cited the left edge of the Sun to	
6:05		compute the Asmus to the edge of the Sun	
6:07		we need to compute what we call the D H	
6:10		correction sometimes DZ correction we're	
6:13		going to say D H	
6:14		the formula for D H is the D H equals	
6:17		the semi diameter divided by the cosine	
6:21		of H if the left edge is cited the	
6:26		correction is subtracted and if the	
6:28		right edge is cited then we would add it	
6:30		why yeah you guessed it because jack	
6:33		says so if you draw a picture you'll see	
6:36		why it is so why can't we just use the	
6:40		semi diameter without dividing by the	
6:42		cosine of H good question it's because	
6:46		as the Sun moves in relation to the	
6:49		local Meridian the spherical triangle	
6:51		changes its shape this changes the size	
6:54		of the D H correction angle it's not	
6:59		important that you understand this it is	
7:01		important that you know about it in our	
7:05		problem the semi diameter which is 1550	
7:08		.7 and the H which is 2805 49 are given	
7:13		the semi diameter changes very little in	
7:16		a 24-hour period only 2/10 of a second	
7:18		and because our observation was so close	
7:21		to zero hours we will use 1550 2.7 H is	
7:29		the vertical angle corrected for	
7:30		parallax and refraction it can also be	
7:33		computed if LH a and latitude and	
7:36		declination are known but that takes	
7:38		time and time again we don't have so	
7:41		we'll just use H given the computed D H	
7:45		is 18 minutes and because the left edge	
7:48		was sighted we're going to subtract the	
7:51		asthma's to the left edge is 269 54 11.8	
8:00		now let's take a look at display and	
8:02		start at the top and compute each factor	
8:05		first we take the computer to asmath the	
8:08		two seventy twelve eleven point eight	
8:10		then subtract the d h correction the 18	
8:13		minutes this gives us the Asmus to the	
8:15		left edge of the Sun 260 954 eleven	
8:19		point eight from this we subtract the	
8:23		angle measured at Station rock from the	
8:25		left edge of the Sun two station rots	
8:28		87 30 56 this angle is given in the	
8:32		problem all this results in the	
8:34		astronomic asmath from rock to rot s--	
8:37		2 23 16 and that's our answer we were	
8:45		done and you thought this was going to	
8:47		be hard the rest of this particular	
8:51		problem asks that we compute the angle	
8:53		of closure a truck but this is not an	
8:56		astronomy question that's getting into	
8:58		the conversion of astronomic asmath the	
9:00		geodetic azimuth and then converting to	
9:02		geodetic azimuth or excuse me to grid	
9:05		azmuth this will be covered in the video	
9:07		detail or dealing with the California	
9:09		coordinate system in the what it's worth	
9:12		Department that answer is 15 seconds we	
9:16		all know that a picture's worth a	
9:17		thousand words so let's take a picture	
9:20		and see just go through this again now	
9:26		North in the picture is true north or	
9:31		astronomic north and the reason it's	
9:34		astronomic north is because we just	
9:35		solved the PGS triangle which is an	
9:37		astronomic triangle the p and the	
9:40		triangle is the North Pole you can see	
9:42		where we had the Azam's to the center of	
9:45		the Sun that was computed from the	
9:46		equation two seventy twelve eleven point	
9:48		eight our little correction of 18 gave	
9:51		us that asmath to the edge the leading	
9:55		edge or the left edge of the Sun to 69	
9:57		4 eleven point eight we then subtract	
0:01		the angle measured at station rock from	
0:04		the left edge of the Sun to station rotz	
0:06		again this is the angle given in the	
0:09		problem	
0:09		87 30 56 and that gives us the asmath	
0:15		from rock to rock 82 23 16 now if this	
0:21		were a polaris problem we deal with it	
0:25		just the same way you could use the same	
0:28		equation everything would be the same	
0:30		except you would not have to compute the	
0:33		D H correction for obvious reasons then	
0:35		you wouldn't have to be citing the left	
0:37		edge of the star the equation shown on	
0:41		the screen	
0:41		can be	
0:42		for computing the asmath when you cite	
0:44		Polaris this equation is a little	
0:47		simpler this equation is also given in	
0:49		your workbook this equation should not	
0:51		be used for the Sun or other stars	
0:54		it works for Polaris because Polaris is	
0:57		so close to the North Pole less than a	
0:59		degree in the equation H is needed if H	
1:03		is not given you would be better off	
1:06		using the hour angle equation because	
1:08		the time it would take to compute H	
1:09		would be more time than just working the	
1:12		hour angle equation the computed azimuth	
1:16		using the Polaris equation is small	
1:18		either east or west of north it is east	
1:21		of North when the LH a is between 180	
1:23		and 360 it is west of north when LH a is	
1:27		between 0 and 180 when it is rest of	
1:31		North and the azmuth is reckoned from	
1:34		north in a clockwise direction will it	
1:36		be like this for you it must be	
1:38		subtracted from 360 what we've covered	
1:42		so far is the kind of problem more than	
1:46		not in the land surveyors examination on	
1:49		astronomy there are times when you're	
1:51		going to get what I'll call a word	
1:53		problem you should burn a candle that	
1:58		you get one of these offer your	
2:01		firstborn to the goddess of examination	
2:03		questions	
2:04		I call these gimmies these kinds of	
2:07		problems do not take time they can be	
2:10		answered without time-consuming	
2:12		computations remember that time is your	
2:14		enemy let's take a look at a gimme	
2:17		problem go to unit 4 on your workbook	
2:20		and find problem b3 from the 1988	
2:23		California land surveyors examination	
2:25		this problem is a 10-point problem that	
2:29		means in this examination you were given	
2:31		8 minutes to work this problem measure	
2:34		that against the time it would take to	
2:36		work the solar problem we just did that	
2:39		was only 5 points this problem has 17	
2:44		questions 15 true or false to	
2:46		multiple-choice if you did nothing more	
2:49		than guess the probabilities are that	
2:52		you could get half of right and that	
2:54		would be 5 points and maybe 5	
2:56		minutes leaving you as much as 43	
2:59		minutes to work on another problem now	
3:01		you can see why I call these friendly	
3:04		problems you're in an open book	
3:06		examination if you just search for the	
3:09		answers you should be able to get maybe	
3:11		seven or eight points in 20 minutes	
3:13		maybe you should offer not only your	
3:15		firstborn but your spouse also that you	
3:18		get one of these let's take the	
3:21		questions one at a time the problem	
3:25		states that if the question is false you	
3:27		should give a brief explanation and the	
3:29		key word there is brief don't spend a	
3:31		lot of time so let's start right out	
3:33		number one astronomic azmuth is based on	
3:37		true north true nothing else to do	
3:41		number two grid azmuth is based on true	
3:45		north well we just said no to that so	
3:48		it's false and we can say see number one	
3:50		for a statement geodetic azmuth is	
3:55		astronomic azimuth - mapping angle plus	
3:58		second term I don't know and I'm the	
4:00		expert you go to a book and you find a	
4:03		formula and you'll find this formula in	
4:05		a publication 253 remember you've got an	
4:08		open book exam and you've brought every	
4:09		book you own to this thing so just look	
4:12		it up and you're going to find that the	
4:14		correct is grid asmath equals geodetic	
4:18		azimuth - mapping angle plus second term	
4:21		number four to determine true north from	
4:26		observations on Polaris the latitude of	
4:29		the observer must be known no false look	
4:33		at the Polaris equation there's no	
4:34		latitude in there and again because	
4:38		you're going to be making just a brief	
4:39		statement just write it down	
4:41		see Polaris equation and then maybe show	
4:43		the Polaris equation with no latitude in	
4:45		it number five gh a equals LH a - west	
4:53		longitude well we've just gone through	
4:56		this but again you don't try to remember	
4:58		equations go to your little ephemeris	
5:01		book and there it is LH a equals G H a -	
5:05		west longitude so you could say false	
5:07		and nothing more than just write the	
5:08		equation down	
5:09		now on to number six the best time to	
5:13		observe the Sun to determine asmath	
5:15		using the altitude method is one half	
5:18		hour after sunrise or one half hour	
5:20		before sunset	
5:21		no false because when you're looking at	
5:26		the altitude method and you're measuring	
5:28		vertical angle you're going to find	
5:30		refraction is just too much to deal with	
5:32		but again in the test you're going to	
5:35		make a brief statement you're going to	
5:36		say false too much refraction period	
5:40		number seven the exact time is more	
5:43		important when using the hour angle	
5:45		method this is true period nothing else	
5:49		to say number eight the hour angle	
5:52		method requires both horizontal and	
5:54		vertical observations to be determined	
5:56		excuse me to determine the asmath know	
5:58		we only have to look at just the	
6:01		vertical observation so you're going to	
6:03		say false horizontal only number nine it	
6:08		is not necessary to know the latitude of	
6:11		the observer when using the hour angle	
6:13		method false see the hour angle equation	
6:17		just write it down	
6:19		see we're flowing right through we're	
6:22		halfway through this and I'll bet we	
6:24		haven't spent even talking about it more	
6:26		than three or four minutes number ten I	
6:30		think we just did number ten no let's do	
6:33		it anyway even if we didn't the best	
6:35		time to observe the Sun for determining	
6:37		asmath using the hour angle method is	
6:40		just after sunrise or just before sunset	
6:42		that's true because you're going to have	
6:45		the Sun lure in the sky and the lower	
6:47		the better with the hour angle method	
6:48		again I'm just kind of telling you why	
6:52		but all you got to do is write true and	
6:53		get onto number eleven standard time	
6:56		must be converted to local time to	
6:57		determine Greenwich Time false again	
7:00		don't try to remember equations just go	
7:03		into the book and find it and we're	
7:05		going to say that the Greenwich time	
7:06		equals standard time plus in this case	
7:09		for California be eight hours depending	
7:12		on what time zone you're in and here	
7:13		we're in the Pacific Standard time zone	
7:16		number 12 local time is increased in	
7:20		California by eight hours	
7:23		to determine Greenwich Time know it's	
7:25		the standard time not the local time and	
7:29		again you could just write out their	
7:30		little equation for that 13 true solar	
7:34		time is local civil time - the equation	
7:37		of time now again there's that pesty old	
7:40		equation of time which again we don't	
7:42		have to worry about because our femoris	
7:45		tables take care of it but here they're	
7:47		asking us about it so what do we do	
7:49		again you don't remember formulas go	
7:51		right to that little leets ephemeris	
7:54		handbook and you'll find about maybe the	
7:57		third column over it'll talk equate	
8:00		right at the top it'll tell you the	
8:01		little equation for the equation of time	
8:03		and just copy it down 14 a level line at	
8:09		sea level is parallel with a level line	
8:11		at 800 feet oh what the heck that got to	
8:13		do with the astronomy I don't know but	
8:15		it's here you know you got to answer it	
8:17		and I'm just gonna say false and I'll	
8:20		just tell you that because you're out	
8:21		there further and centrifugal force is	
8:23		working harder on it you're going to	
8:25		have a more of an elliptical path than	
8:28		you would at the sea level so it's not	
8:30		going to be parallel and that's about as	
8:32		much as you'd want to say about that in	
8:34		fact it doesn't even belong in there but	
8:35		again what can you gonna do about it	
8:38		5:1 satiereal day is longer than one	
8:40		solar day measured in civil time	
8:42		remember our three-dimensional model	
8:44		when we were looking at the star and we	
8:47		could come all the way around and we	
8:49		would face the star a little bit before	
8:51		the end of the solar day so we know that	
8:53		the solar day is short excuse me	
8:55		that the Syria Saudi riyal day is	
8:57		shorter the solar day longer so a number	
9:01		of 15 would be false saudi riyal day is	
9:03		3 hours 56 minutes and then we got two	
9:07		more to go and I'll bet we still haven't	
9:09		used seven or eight minutes and again	
9:13		right here let's say you take a hatpin	
9:14		and you just pick a B C or D maybe your	
9:17		chances aren't as great with true or	
9:19		false but you could do it but let's go	
9:21		ahead and go through them anyway at what	
9:23		time will the effect of a small air in	
9:25		the determination of the observers	
9:27		latitude be minimized when making	
9:29		azimuth observations on Polaris	
9:32		I will peek at the answer and it says C	
9:34		see	
9:36		the Polaris is at culmination ok just	
9:39		allow that at culmination you're right	
9:42		on line with the star so it wouldn't	
9:46		matter if you're way down here a way up	
9:47		here it ain't going to change the azmuth	
9:48		NE so naturally it culmination would be	
9:50		the answer	
9:51		moving right on to the last one number	
9:53		7 at what time will the effect of a	
9:56		small air in the determination of the	
9:58		time of the observers assumed me of the	
0:01		observation be minimized when making	
0:03		asmath observations on Polaris well	
0:06		again this would be because when the	
0:09		star which is making its circle and I	
0:11		may be showing it wrong it's you know	
0:13		I'm looking at you you're looking at me	
0:14		just allow us going around in a circle	
0:15		when it's at the outer edges it appears	
0:18		to be only moving vertically and time is	
0:20		not very critical so elongation would be	
0:22		the answer let's see if I got that right	
0:25		number 17 says be haha look at that	
0:29		Polaris at elongation and we're done	
0:32		we've used up I doubt if we zoomed up	
0:35		used up ten minutes and again you know	
0:37		there's 43 minutes to work another	
0:39		problem well that covers the kind of	
0:47		problems that you're going to get in	
0:48		this LS examination they're going to be	
0:50		there be a problem you're gonna have to	
0:51		work out some numbers that you hope you	
0:53		don't get or a word problem like you say	
0:55		you're gonna be praying to get and let	
0:57		me add just a little bit more on how to	
0:59		maybe approach the examination whether	
1:01		it be astronomy or other questions again	
1:05		remembering the time is your enemy	
1:08		take the examination when it's given to	
1:10		you open it up look at the first	
1:12		question and say hey do I know this is	
1:16		the time fair let's say you look at the	
1:18		first one and you say I don't even what	
1:20		they're talking about go right onto the	
1:22		second one it doesn't matter about time	
1:24		the second problem you look at and this	
1:26		is hey I know how to answer this but	
1:28		it'd probably take me a day and a half	
1:29		to do it go right on to the next one put	
1:32		little checkmarks by these problems that	
1:34		you're not going to work number three	
1:35		it's a problem you know and you say hey	
1:38		the the time is about fair I think I can	
1:41		do this work problem number three	
1:43		problem number four same thing I don't	
1:46		know what it is problem number five hey	
1:49		again times fair I know how to work and	
1:52		I work problem number five you can see	
1:54		what I'm getting at here I'm working the	
1:56		problems that I'm going to get the best	
1:58		points from I can go through the whole	
2:00		examination like this and I may end up	
2:04		only working let's say it's a 10-point	
2:06		or seeing me a ten problem exam and I've	
2:09		only worked six of them I go right back	
2:11		to the beginning again and number one	
2:13		don't know how to work it don't bother	
2:16		with it on to number two okay again I	
2:19		know how to work it but it takes too	
2:20		much time I don't work this one because	
2:23		I remember one in the back was the same	
2:26		thing except I could work it the time	
2:28		wasn't quite as bad I go back and I work	
2:30		that problem let's say I go through the	
2:32		whole examination like this and I end up	
2:34		only maybe answering eight of the ten	
2:36		problems but I picked the best eight the	
2:40		two that I didn't work are - I shouldn't	
2:42		have been working with anyway spinning	
2:44		my wheels where I could have been	
2:45		getting good points so you see what I'm	
2:48		talking about you want to enhance your	
2:51		chances of getting the best chance of	
2:54		working the problems that are going to	
2:56		give you the best points now there's no	
3:00		magic but the better prepared you are	
3:03		and again I know that's been beat to	
3:05		death but it's a fact the better	
3:07		prepared you are the more selective you	
3:10		are about the problems you work first	
3:11		the more you enhance your chances of	
3:13		getting a passing score so guys gals	
3:17		good luck and break a leg	
3:47		you
