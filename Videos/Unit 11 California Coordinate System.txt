01:14		just those in this courses workbook but	
01:17		problems from other sources as well	
01:19		this course is funded by Caltrans but	
01:23		you and I owe a profound thanks to	
01:26		others the courses instructors from the	
01:29		academic community the private sector	
01:31		other public agencies and from Caltrans	
01:34		as well we wish you well in your study	
01:38		toward becoming a member of California's	
01:40		professional land surveying community	
01:44		welcome to today's discussion of the	
01:47		state plane coordinate system a 1986	
01:51		changed the public resources code of the	
01:54		state of California created the	
01:56		California coordinate system of 1983	
01:59		noted as CCS 83 the implementation of	
02:04		the system is to be phased in by January	
02:06		st 1995 when state plane work must	
02:11		refer to it in most cases it replaces	
02:14		the previous system of 1927 the old	
02:19		North American datum of 1927 developed	
02:23		by the US Coast and geodetic survey was	
02:26		the basis for CCS 27 that used an	
02:30		approximation of the Earth's surface in	
02:32		North America named Clark's Sparrow I'd	
02:35		of 1866 as its geodetic reference	
02:38		surface the North American datum of 1983	
02:43		that's nad 83 developed by the National	
02:47		geodetic survey underlies CCS 83 a new	
02:52		ellipsoid the geodetic reference system	
02:55		of 1980 also called grsat	
02:59		is the basis of the new system this	
03:02		ellipsoid is geocentric and approximates	
03:05		the surface of the entire earth not just	
03:08		North America because the geodetic	
03:11		reference surfaces are different the	
03:14		nad27 latitude and the longitude of a	
03:16		station differ from the nad83 values for	
03:20		the same station overlying those	
03:23		differences are the factors that the	
03:26		adjustment incorporated new observations	
03:29		the adjustment used was a least squares	
03:32		simultaneous adjustment of the entire	
03:34		system and that blunders could be	
03:37		isolated and called in fact the	
03:40		variation between the two coordinate	
03:42		systems very inconsistently making only	
03:46		approximate transforms possible at	
03:49		present rigorous computation of	
03:52		coordinates is only possible by	
03:54		returning to the original field	
03:56		observations readjusting and recomputing	
03:59		positions from them the designers of the	
04:02		coordinate system limited the	
04:04		north-south extent of each lambert grid	
04:07		to meet certain predetermined criteria	
04:10		therefore six zones comprise CCS	
04:14		eighty-three zone one is at the north	
04:17		end of the state the zone numbers	
04:20		increased southerly until zone six	
04:23		extends to the Mexican border each zone	
04:26		is based upon a cone whose axis is	
04:30		coincident with the grsat spheroid axis	
04:33		of rotation the cone is a secant cone	
04:38		because it intersects the surface of the	
04:41		ellipsoid at two standard parallels	
04:43		rather than simply resting on it this	
04:47		minimizes distortion while projecting	
04:50		data from the ellipsoid onto the cone as	
04:54		enacted by the state by the state	
04:57		legislature the new coordinate systems	
05:00		linear units can either be meters or	
05:02		u.s. survey feet to date NGS has	
05:07		implemented nad83	
05:09		as a metric system has published all si	
05:12		csa III station data in meters state	
05:17		plane coordinates expressed in one unit	
05:20		can be converted to the other unit	
05:22		simply by multiplying northing and	
05:24		easting by the foot meter equivalency	
05:27		this will be described later in this	
05:30		presentation one may work the California	
05:34		coordinate system in either feet or in	
05:36		meters but one must be consistent not	
05:41		only must all distances be uniformly in	
05:43		feet or in meters but tabled constants	
05:46		must also correspond consistently with	
05:49		the linear unit used this discussion is	
05:54		presented in terms of meters but the	
05:56		accompanying written material is	
05:58		presented both in feet and in meters the	
06:03		NGS recommends using polynomial	
06:05		coefficients and algebraic equations to	
06:08		simplify calculations for state plane	
06:11		coordinates polynomial coefficients are	
06:14		easy to use	
06:15		therefore they are appropriate for both	
06:17		manual and programmed calculation	
06:21		applications through their use	
06:23		projection tables become unnecessary	
06:27		they can produce millimetre millimeter	
06:29		accuracy these in handheld calculators	
06:32		carrying only 10 significant digits the	
06:37		ng has developed the coefficients by	
06:39		polynomial curve fitting of an array of	
06:42		data points for each zone for those	
06:45		wishing to use projection tables the	
06:48		California land surveyors Association	
06:50		has published a book of projection	
06:52		tables as special publication number 55	
06:55		/ 88 NGS is now publishing a similar	
07:01		table please be aware if you are	
07:05		preparing for the land surveyors	
07:07		examination the new coordinate system	
07:10		will be phased in through the beginning	
07:12		of 1995 however nothing prevents the	
07:16		State Board from asking questions about	
07:18		the older system on future examinations	
07:21		you need to prepare for both while this	
07:24		presentation concentrates on the	
07:26		California coordinate system of 1983 it	
07:30		is broadly applicable to the system of	
07:32		927 calculations for the older system	
07:36		are not as sophisticated as those used	
07:39		now therefore if you understand the	
07:43		system of 1983 is much easier to master	
07:47		the older system state plane coordinate	
07:51		systems are intended to permit the	
07:53		calculation of positions on a grid using	
07:57		measurements made on the curving surface	
07:59		of the earth and at different elevations	
08:02		if those measurements are accurately	
08:05		made and extended over a long distance	
08:08		plane geometry calculations will yield	
08:11		inconsistent values for the position of	
08:14		the stations the state plane coordinate	
08:17		systems were devised to provide a	
08:20		calculation technique that produces	
08:22		coordinate values that correctly relate	
08:25		to each other even over long distances	
08:28		and compared favorably with those	
08:30		calculated by geometric mean by geodetic	
08:33		means first we will look at a series of	
08:37		pictures to help us visualize the	
08:40		coordinate system the first set of	
08:43		illustrations is intended to acquaint us	
08:46		with the relationship between the	
08:47		ellipsoid and the cone that is the basis	
08:51		of the system we now see depicted the	
08:55		geodetic reference system of 1980 also	
08:59		referred to as a GRS 80 system ellipsoid	
09:03		it approximates the shape of the planet	
09:06		Earth like the earth it is slightly	
09:09		flattened the polar radius is about even	
09:12		3 miles less than the equatorial radius	
09:15		the GRS 80 ellipsoid underlies the	
09:20		California coordinate system of 1983 or	
09:23		CCS 83 the National geodetic survey	
09:29		developed the recently revised	
09:31		coordinate system the system uses	
09:34		information from the North American	
09:36		datum of 1983 nattai	
09:39		three adjusted during the period 1975	
09:43		through 1986 we also see depicted the	
09:48		axis of rotation of the ellipsoid that	
09:51		is the same as our planet's earth's axis	
09:56		we now see the addition of the equator	
09:58		the equator is formed by the	
10:02		intersection of the surface of the	
10:04		ellipsoid with a plane that is at right	
10:06		angle to the axis of rotation and	
10:09		located midway between the poles of the	
10:11		ellipsoid next two latitudes are	
10:15		presented north of the equator these two	
10:19		latitudes are defining elements for each	
10:21		portion of the California coordinate	
10:23		system each selected latitude is called	
10:27		an exact scale or standard parallel	
10:30		latitude is measured by the angle formed	
10:33		at the intersection of the equatorial	
10:38		plane with a line normal to the surface	
10:41		of the ellipsoid the two latitudes are	
10:44		called the North and South exact	
10:46		parallels and noted as B sub N and B sub	
10:52		s now we see a cone generated through	
10:56		the two exact scale parallels this means	
10:59		that it is a secant cone in other words	
11:03		the surface of the cone is within the	
11:05		surface of the ellipsoid between the	
11:07		standard parallels and outside it	
11:10		towards its apex and towards its skirt	
11:14		the axis of the cone is coincident with	
11:17		the axis of rotation of the ellipsoid	
11:20		for each unique pair of standard	
11:23		parallels a unique cone will be created	
11:28		another parallel of latitude occurs	
11:31		between the two standard parallels where	
11:34		the separation between the ellipsoid	
11:35		surface and the cone is greatest this	
11:38		latitude is nearly midway between the	
11:40		standard parallels and therefore it's	
11:43		name is the central parallel its	
11:45		notation is B sub o representing the	
11:49		latitude of the origin	
11:52		of the projection each zone has its own	
11:55		central parallel a tabled constant for	
11:58		that zone for each zone the geometry of	
12:02		the cone fixes the distance from the	
12:04		apex to the central parallel the	
12:07		notation for that distance is R sub o	
12:11		standing for the mapping radius of the	
12:13		projection origin the angle between the	
12:18		axis of the cone and its surface will	
12:21		have a value that is equal to the	
12:24		latitude of the projection origin next	
12:29		we see a geodetic meridian of Latta the	
12:31		longitude projected onto the cone that	
12:34		is a true north-south line the designer	
12:38		of the zone has selected a particular	
12:40		Meridian to fulfill best the needs of	
12:43		those who will use the zone it will form	
12:46		the center of the east/west extent of	
12:48		the zone therefore it is called the	
12:51		central Meridian and as a tabled	
12:53		constant at the intersection of the	
12:56		central Meridian with the central	
12:58		parallel is the projection origin now we	
13:04		see the addition of another parallel of	
13:06		latitude it is the North geodetic	
13:09		latitude of the grid origin and it's	
13:11		ordered at its intersection with the	
13:13		central Meridian as the origin of the	
13:15		grid in every zone that point is	
13:18		assigned a northern value of 500,000	
13:21		meters and an easting value of 2 million	
13:24		meters the notation for the latitude of	
13:27		the grid origin has B sub B because	
13:30		through it will pass the baseline of the	
13:32		grid associated with grid latitude of	
13:36		the grid origin is a particular distance	
13:39		from the apex of the cone this distance	
13:42		is known as the mapping radius through	
13:44		the grid origin noted as R sub B it is a	
13:47		tabled constant for each zone next we	
13:51		see the customary north-south limits of	
13:53		the grid and the customary east-west	
13:55		limits of the grid illustrated these	
13:58		limits are customary only when there is	
14:00		good reason for doing so the grid may be	
14:03		expanded beyond them	
14:05		before we continue to the our next	
14:08		graphic let's look at a simple model	
14:11		with a paper cone are presenting the	
14:14		large cone with its apex way above the	
14:18		North Pole of the ellipsoid on this cone	
14:22		we can see that the geodetic meridians	
14:25		have been projected through and they	
14:28		form now north side north south geodetic	
14:31		lines you'll also see that the latitude	
14:35		line has been projected through so that	
14:38		they form what appeared to be parallels	
14:40		on the cone surface now the interesting	
14:44		thing that this cone is to illustrate is	
14:47		that when we develop this cone that is	
14:49		when we flatten it out which we'll do	
14:51		right now those lines that appeared to	
14:56		be parallel become large semi circles	
15:01		here and the lines that used to be	
15:06		running to the apex of the zone now	
15:09		converge at a point so the geodetic	
15:12		meridians converge while the parallels	
15:16		of latitude become large arts of circles	
15:22		we will now see a series of pictures	
15:26		portraying the developed cone that is	
15:28		the cone once it has opened up and	
15:30		flattened into a plane on that developed	
15:33		cone we will see the various lines that	
15:36		relate it and the grid that creates	
15:39		state plane coordinate system this	
15:43		picture shows the cone for a zone	
15:45		developed that is opened up and	
15:47		flattened the cone entirely encircled	
15:50		the ellipsoid in other words it	
15:52		represents a full 360 degrees of	
15:55		longitude but now that it has been	
15:57		developed the central angle at the apex	
16:00		of the cone is considerably less than	
16:03		60 degrees the central angle at the	
16:07		apex of the developed cone equals 360	
16:10		degrees times sine b sub o this gives us	
16:14		the ratio that we can use to proportion	
16:17		differences in lunge	
16:18		when calculating the corresponding	
16:21		central angle on the developed cone sine	
16:24		B sub O is the sine of the latitude of	
16:27		the projection origin a tabled constant	
16:31		the latitudinal line Illustrated for are	
16:34		developed cone is B sub o through the	
16:37		projection origin we see that the	
16:43		mapping radius of B sub O has been	
16:46		labeled as R sub o is the distance from	
16:49		the line of latitude B sub o to the apex	
16:52		of the cone a tabled constant now added	
16:55		as the northern axis the northern axis	
16:58		coincides with the central Meridian	
17:00		therefore it's longitude is the same as	
17:03		that of the central Meridian passing	
17:04		through the projection and grid origins	
17:07		next we see the addition of another	
17:10		latitudinal line and its mapping radius	
17:13		the latitude is that of the parallel	
17:16		passing through the grid origin its	
17:19		latitude is noted as B sub B that is a	
17:23		tabled constant for each zone the	
17:26		mapping radius is labeled as R sub B it	
17:29		is the mapping radius through the grid	
17:31		origin and as a tabled constant next we	
17:35		see the addition of the easting axis it	
17:38		passes through the grid origin and is at	
17:41		a right angle to the central meridian	
17:45		next can be seen lines of longitude	
17:48		approximately delineating the customary	
17:50		east-west limits of the zone also added	
17:54		as a segment of the latitude	
17:56		approximately delineating the customary	
17:59		northerly limit of zone the customary	
18:03		southerly limit is the easting axis next	
18:08		a meridian of longitude extends from the	
18:10		apex of the cone to a station which	
18:13		coincidentally is on the central	
18:15		parallel a longitude is a true	
18:18		north-south geodetic line a geodetic	
18:21		meridian the notation for the west	
18:24		geodetic longitude of a station has	
18:26		capital L if we create a grid	
18:31		a grid North line through the station it	
18:34		will be parallel with the northern axis	
18:37		the plane convergence angle is the angle	
18:40		formed on the developed cone between the	
18:43		central Meridian and the line of	
18:45		longitude through the station lower case	
18:48		gamma symbolizes the plane convergence	
18:51		angle it can be seen on the screen that	
18:55		the difference between grid north and	
18:57		geodetic north at the station equals the	
19:00		plane convergence angle at the apex of	
19:02		the developed cone the plane convergence	
19:05		angle is equal to the difference between	
19:08		the longitude of the central Meridian	
19:10		and the longitude through the station	
19:12		multiplied times sine b sub o both the	
19:17		longitude of the central meridian l sub	
19:19		o and sine of b sub o are tabled	
19:22		constants for each zone this principle	
19:25		imposes the same proportioning	
19:27		previously imposed upon the central	
19:29		angle for the entire cone let's now look	
19:34		at another set of illustrations dealing	
19:36		with the grid it will make clear the	
19:39		grids construction and its relationship	
19:41		to certain elements of the cone and	
19:43		Lipsyte on the screen we see the two	
19:47		standard parallels of geodetic latitude	
19:49		each California coordinate system zone	
19:52		has two of these lines of exact scale	
19:54		where the cone intersects the surface of	
19:57		the GRS eighty ellipsoid the northerly	
20:00		one is noted as B sub N and the	
20:02		southerly as B sub s now we see the	
20:06		circular arc of the central parallel	
20:08		added to the illustration noted as B sub	
20:12		o there's a parallel of latitude that is	
20:14		approximately midway between the	
20:16		standard parallels along this line	
20:18		occurs the minimum scale within the zone	
20:21		associated with the central parallel is	
20:23		its mapping radius the distance from the	
20:26		apex of the cone to the central parallel	
20:28		a distance notice noted as R sub o both	
20:33		the latitude of the central parallel	
20:35		that's mapping radius are tabled	
20:37		constants next we see the addition of	
20:40		the central Meridian that is the	
20:42		projection of a true north-south	
20:44		geodetic line	
20:45		noted as l sub o the central Meridian	
20:50		also is the northing axis of the grid it	
20:53		passes through both the projection	
20:54		origin and the grid origin as such it's	
20:57		notation is also e sub o by definition	
21:02		the central meridian has an Easton value	
21:04		of two million meters in all zones at	
21:08		the intersection of the central parallel	
21:10		and the central Meridian is the origin	
21:12		of the projection this location has	
21:15		geodetic coordinates that is latitude	
21:17		longitude of B sub o by L sub o we now	
21:22		see another parallel of latitude has	
21:24		been added that it is B sub B that is	
21:27		the projection of the geodetic latitude	
21:29		passing through the grid origin as a	
21:31		tabled constant it also has a particular	
21:34		mapping radius associated with it a	
21:36		tabled constant notice R sub being at	
21:39		the intersection of the central meridian	
21:41		with B sub B is the origin of the grid	
21:45		consequently its genetic coordinates are	
21:47		B sub B by L sub o through the grid	
21:51		origin and at a right angle to the	
21:53		central meridian friends the easting	
21:55		axis of the grid it is the base line of	
21:58		the grid noted as n sub B a northern	
22:02		value of 500,000 meters is associated to	
22:05		the with the easting axis therefore the	
22:09		origin of the grid has plane coordinates	
22:11		of 500,000 metres northing by 2 million	
22:14		meters east team this is true for all	
22:16		zones by definition parallel with the	
22:19		base line of the grid and passing	
22:21		through the projection origin is an	
22:23		east-west grid line its northern value	
22:26		is noted as n sub o a tabled constant	
22:29		therefore the grid coordinates of the	
22:32		projection origin are n sub o by e sub o	
22:37		on the screen we see the approximate	
22:39		customary east/west extent of the zone	
22:42		depicted these limits are customary only	
22:45		but is usually not necessary to extend	
22:48		the coordinate zones too far into the	
22:50		Pacific Ocean or into adjacent States	
22:53		easterly of us next on the screen we see	
22:56		the approximate north-south customer	
22:58		limits of the grid the customary	
23:01		southerly limit is the baseline of the	
23:03		grid more gridlines are added parallel	
23:07		with the northern axis each line runs	
23:09		grid north	
23:10		remember that geodetic meridians	
23:13		converge toward the apex of the cone	
23:15		while grid meridians are not parallel	
23:18		are all parallel therefore the	
23:21		difference between geodetic north and	
23:23		grid north at any particular point on	
23:25		the grid depends upon the position of	
23:28		the point now grid lines paralleling the	
23:31		easting axes have been added to the	
23:33		display	
23:34		they all run grid East and at a right	
23:37		angle to the north/south grid lines now	
23:41		that we understand the basic geometry of	
23:43		the ellipsoid cone and grid we will view	
23:46		a series of pictures illustrating the	
23:48		geometry that allows us to convert	
23:50		geodetic coordinates in other words	
23:53		latitude and longitude to state plane	
23:55		coordinates are familiar northings and	
23:57		eastings we now see on the screen a	
24:01		single line of latitude projected onto	
24:06		the developed cone surface this line of	
24:09		latitude is the central parallel of the	
24:11		zone noted as B sub o the central	
24:15		parallel is a tabled constant for each	
24:17		zone we now see the central meridian a	
24:22		geodetic north line added to the picture	
24:25		on the screen this line is also the	
24:28		northern axis of the grid all other grid	
24:31		North lines will be parallel with it	
24:33		it's each team value is 2 million meters	
24:37		by definition that value is known as EC	
24:40		Bo and is a tabled constant the	
24:43		intersection of the central meridian	
24:44		with the central parallel is the	
24:46		projection origin now we add the easting	
24:50		axis or base line of the grid noted as n	
24:53		sub B this line runs at a right angle to	
24:56		the northern axis its northern value as	
25:00		a tabled constant and as 500,000 metres	
25:03		by definition this northern value	
25:06		sometimes is called its false northing	
25:08		the intersection of the northern axis	
25:11		with	
25:12		easting access as the origin of the grid	
25:14		the screen now shows a dimension line	
25:18		extending from the apex of the cone to	
25:20		the grid origin this distance is the	
25:23		mapping radius through the grid origin	
25:25		known as R sub B it is a tabled constant	
25:29		by inspection we can see that by adding	
25:32		together n sub B and R sub B we can	
25:36		calculate the northing of the apex now	
25:39		added to the display is a station at	
25:42		which the geodetic coordinates and the	
25:45		grid coordinates are to be equated we	
25:48		see a parallel of latitude added through	
25:51		the station its latitude is noted as	
25:54		capital V next added is a geodetic	
25:57		meridian of longitude extending from the	
26:00		apex of the cone to the station the	
26:02		notation for its longitude is capital L	
26:07		now another line has been added	
26:09		it is a line through the station	
26:12		extended at a right angle from the	
26:13		northing axis the latitude through the	
26:16		station has a particular mapping radius	
26:19		associated with it labeled as capital R	
26:22		the length of the mapping radius through	
26:25		the station can be measured along the	
26:27		Meridian from the apex to the station as	
26:31		shown on the screen now the central	
26:33		parallel has its own particular mapping	
26:36		radius noted as R sub o it is a tabled	
26:40		constant the value of the mapping radius	
26:43		R through our station will be needed for	
26:45		converting geodetic coordinates to state	
26:48		plane coordinates and vice versa so that	
26:51		we can do this NGS devised a method to	
26:55		calculate the radial distance between	
26:57		the parallel of latitude through our	
26:59		station and the central parallel it	
27:03		involves the use of equations employing	
27:05		tabled coefficients and the difference	
27:08		in latitude between the origin of the	
27:10		projection and the station the distance	
27:13		obtained by this method is labeled small	
27:15		U on the screen when they station is	
27:19		north of the central parallel U is	
27:21		negative when the station is south it is	
27:24		positive	
27:25		by inspection it is impaired it is	
27:27		apparent that the mapping radius of our	
27:30		station are equals the sum of the	
27:33		mapping radius through the central	
27:34		parallel R sub o and the radial	
27:37		difference you remember that we	
27:41		previously discussed that the central	
27:44		angle of the developed cone could be	
27:46		found by multiplying 360 degrees of	
27:49		longitude by sine B sub o similarly an	
27:54		angle on the grid between the central	
27:56		Meridian and then the other geodetic	
27:58		Meridian can be found by multiplying	
28:00		their difference of longitude by sine B	
28:03		sub o this angle is the plane	
28:05		convergence angle located at the apex of	
28:07		the cone the plane convergence angle	
28:10		sometimes is called the mapping angle	
28:12		its symbol is the lowercase Greek letter	
28:15		gamma we now can see that we have	
28:19		developed a giant right triangle the	
28:21		conversion triangle one leg of it is the	
28:24		mapping radius through the station when	
28:27		angle of the triangle is the plane	
28:29		convergence through the station using	
28:31		classical Euclidean trigonometry we can	
28:34		calculate the other two legs of the	
28:36		giant triangle as noted on the screen	
28:39		the leg along the northern axis of the	
28:42		grid can be found by multiplying the	
28:43		mapping radius through the station R by	
28:47		the cosine of the plain convergence	
28:49		angle this yields the difference in	
28:51		northings between the apex of the cone	
28:53		and our station remember that we	
28:56		previously determined that adding n sub	
28:59		B with R sub B yielded the northing of	
29:02		the apex therefore subtracting the value	
29:05		R cosine gamma yields the northing of	
29:09		the station the northing is noted by the	
29:11		small letter n next we see that the	
29:18		remaining leg of the giant conversion	
29:20		triangle labeled R sine gamma is shown	
29:26		the value found by solving this	
29:28		trigonometric equation is positive if	
29:31		the Station is east of the northern axis	
29:33		and negative if west we can calculate	
29:36		the easting of our station noted	
29:38		small e by adding the result to e sub o	
29:42		thus we have a method to convert our	
29:45		station's geodetic coordinates B and L	
29:48		to it's a quick equivalent grid	
29:51		coordinates small N and small e	
29:54		reversing the procedure provides for the	
29:56		inverse computation starting with plain	
29:59		coordinates and going to geodetic	
30:01		coordinates we will cover three broad	
30:04		classes of calculations for state plane	
30:06		coordinate systems in this presentation	
30:08		they are first conversions of	
30:11		coordinates between ellipsoid and grid	
30:13		second manipulation of observations	
30:16		these are adjustments applied to lengths	
30:19		and Asmus when converting field	
30:21		measurements to grid values and vice	
30:23		versa	
30:24		third transformations from zone to zone	
30:28		we first will consider forward or direct	
30:32		computation which is the conversion from	
30:35		geodetic coordinates to plane	
30:36		coordinates in other words we will	
30:39		change latitude and longitude of a	
30:41		station into the corresponding northing	
30:43		and easting director forward mapping	
30:46		equations are used to compute state	
30:49		plane coordinates from geodetic	
30:50		coordinates and the forward computation	
30:53		we must find the mapping radius through	
30:56		the station this may be done in two ways	
30:59		the first is by using tabled polynomial	
31:02		coefficients the method preferred by NGS	
31:05		the coefficients are used in algebraic	
31:08		equations to revive the missing link in	
31:11		calculating the mapping radius through	
31:13		the station this missing link is the	
31:15		radial distance noted as small you	
31:18		previously illustrated the polynomial	
31:21		equations are straightforward although	
31:23		the numbers are long but let us not	
31:26		forget that the machine does the hard	
31:28		work all that we must do is press the	
31:31		buttons accurately another method for	
31:34		determining the mapping radius is to	
31:36		interpolate it from projection tables	
31:38		this will be discussed in its proper	
31:41		place during our discussion of forward	
31:43		computation we begin by calculating the	
31:46		difference of latitude between the	
31:48		station to be converted and that of the	
31:50		central parallel	
31:53		this equation takes the north latitude	
31:55		of the station noted as B and subtracts	
31:59		the latitude of the projection origin on	
32:01		the central parallel a tabled constant	
32:04		noted as B sub o it yields the	
32:07		difference in latitude between them if	
32:09		working on a calculator computing only	
32:11		ten significant digits such as the HP	
32:14		forty one it is necessary when	
32:18		subtracting latitudes to truncate tens	
32:20		of degrees that is if the latitude is	
32:23		thirty doing 33 degrees truncate it to	
32:26		three degrees we can now use the	
32:29		difference within latitude just	
32:31		calculated to compute the value of u	
32:34		remember that we previously saw that U	
32:37		is the radial distance from the station	
32:39		to the central parallel we will use L	
32:43		polynomial coefficients for this	
32:45		calculation these coefficients can be	
32:48		found listed at the end of the	
32:49		California coordinate system written	
32:51		material each zone has its own set they	
32:55		also different four feet or 4 meters	
32:58		using the latitude difference just	
33:00		obtained we enter it into an either	
33:03		equation now displayed on the screen to	
33:06		calculate the value of U some persons	
33:10		feel that the second equation is easier	
33:12		for handheld solution because it has a	
33:14		nested form each equation takes the	
33:17		difference in latitude or the difference	
33:19		raised to a power and multiplies it	
33:21		times a polynomial coefficient that is	
33:24		tabled with the zone constants each	
33:26		coefficient used in these equations is	
33:29		noted with the capital L each has a sub	
33:32		scripted number to indicate its proper	
33:34		position within the equation beefer be	
33:37		careful to keep track of arithmetic	
33:39		signs the radial difference u has a	
33:42		positive value if the station lies	
33:45		northerly of the central parallel and a	
33:47		negative value if it lies southerly	
33:51		after we have calculated u the radial	
33:54		distance from the station to the central	
33:56		parallel we can calculate the mapping	
33:59		radius for our station the equation now	
34:03		displays shows that by taking the length	
34:05		the mapping radius of the central	
34:07		parallel R sub o and subtracting the	
34:10		radial distance measured from the	
34:12		station to the central parallel u we	
34:15		calculate the mapping radius through the	
34:18		station be careful with arithmetic signs	
34:21		an alternative to using polynomial	
34:24		coefficients is obtaining the mapping	
34:26		radius from projection tables if they	
34:29		are available the projection tables are	
34:32		entered with the latitude of the station	
34:34		and the mapping radius can be read in an	
34:36		adjacent column usually projection	
34:39		tables list latitude in whole minutes	
34:41		there are 4 values of the mapping radius	
34:44		for a latitude line between Oh minutes	
34:46		must be interpolated remember from our	
34:50		previous discussion that during a	
34:52		forward conversion we're solving a giant	
34:54		right triangle whether obtaining whether	
34:58		obtained using polynomial coefficients	
34:59		or from projection tables we now know	
35:03		the mapping radius of our station in	
35:06		other words we now know the length of	
35:08		the the hypotenuse of our giant right	
35:12		triangle the conversion triangle next we	
35:15		must find the value of the angle of our	
35:18		conversion triangle located at the apex	
35:21		of the cone as we learned earlier this	
35:24		angle is the plane convergence angle to	
35:28		determine the plane convergence angle	
35:30		symbolized by lowercase gamma we use the	
35:33		equation displayed on the screen it	
35:35		determines the difference between the	
35:37		longitude of the central Meridian a	
35:39		tabled constant noted as L sub o and the	
35:42		west longitude through the station noted	
35:45		as L it then proportions that difference	
35:48		by sine B sub o a tabled constant this	
35:52		is the same relationship that the	
35:53		central angle of the developed cone has	
35:56		to 360 degrees of longitude as	
35:59		previously discussed if working on a	
36:02		calculator computing only 10 significant	
36:04		digits such as the HP forty one is	
36:07		necessary when subtracting longitudes in	
36:09		this equation to truncate tens and	
36:12		hundreds of degrees that is if the	
36:14		longitude is 117 degrees truncate it to	
36:19		/2	
36:20		furthermore it is necessary to carry all	
36:23		significant digits for this calculation	
36:26		therefore is suggested that you use	
36:29		register or stack arithmetic now that we	
36:33		know both the length of the hypotenuse	
36:35		in the angle at the apex of the cone we	
36:38		may use them to solve our conversion	
36:40		triangle it's solution provides the	
36:42		remaining elements needed to calculate	
36:44		the northing and easting of our station	
36:47		first we calculate the northing of our	
36:50		station using the equation displayed on	
36:52		the screen	
36:53		it adds the mapping radius of the grid	
36:56		origin R sub B to the northing of the	
36:59		grid origin n sub B this gives us the	
37:02		northing of the apex of the cone we then	
37:05		solve our cosine gamma which is the	
37:09		difference in northings between the apex	
37:12		and the station this is then subtracted	
37:14		from the northern of apex leaving only	
37:17		the northing of the station noted as	
37:20		small end finally we calculate the	
37:23		easting of the station by solving our	
37:27		sine gamma we find the easting	
37:30		difference between the central meridian	
37:32		and the station the value will be	
37:34		positive if the station is east of the	
37:36		central meridian negative if it is west	
37:39		add the value to e sub o the easting of	
37:42		the central meridian to obtain the	
37:44		easting of the station noted as small e	
37:48		we now have finished the process known	
37:52		as direct or forward computation we	
37:55		begin with the latitude and longitude of	
37:57		a station its geodetic coordinates and	
38:01		we converted them to their equivalent	
38:03		northing and easting its plane	
38:05		coordinates next we will study inverse	
38:09		mapping equations which are to convert	
38:12		plane coordinates to geodetic latitude	
38:14		and longitude the geodetic coordinates	
38:19		are measured on the ellipsoid of	
38:21		reference as latitude and longitude	
38:23		while the northing and easting is on the	
38:25		grid either polynomial coefficients or	
38:29		projection tables may be used in the	
38:31		process first we must solve for the	
38:34		plane convergence angle this equation	
38:38		subtracts Isa both the easting of the	
38:40		grid origin from the easting of the	
38:43		station noted as small e this yields the	
38:46		difference in eastings from the northing	
38:48		axis to the station yet then divides	
38:51		that difference by the sum of R sub B	
38:54		the mapping radius of the grid base	
38:56		which is the constant and n sub B the	
38:59		northing of the grid base less the	
39:03		northing of the station small n this	
39:06		quantity is the difference in northings	
39:08		from the apex of the cone to the station	
39:10		these two quantities are the opposite	
39:14		and adjacent legs of the large	
39:15		conversion triangle it is necessary to	
39:19		carry all significant digits of the	
39:21		plane convergence angle resulting from	
39:24		this calculation	
39:25		therefore you should use register or	
39:28		stack arithmetic next we proportion the	
39:32		plane convergence angle by dividing by	
39:35		sine b sub o this is the reverse the	
39:39		procedure that we saw earlier when	
39:42		learning forward computation this	
39:46		equation is used to calculate the	
39:48		longitude through the station remember	
39:51		in our previous discussion we found that	
39:53		we can proportion or scale the	
39:55		difference in longitudes between the	
39:57		central Meridian and a station by the	
40:00		tabled constant sine B sub o when	
40:03		calculating the plane convergence angle	
40:06		this equation takes the plane	
40:08		convergence angle symbolized by	
40:11		lowercase gamma	
40:12		divides it by sine B sub o they're	
40:15		buying calculating the difference in	
40:17		longitudes we then subtract that	
40:20		difference from the longitude of the	
40:22		central Meridian L sub o to calculate	
40:26		the longitude through our station noted	
40:28		as L if working on a calculator	
40:31		computing only 10 significant digits	
40:34		such as the HP 41 it is necessary when	
40:38		subtracting longitudes in this equation	
40:40		to truncate tens and hundreds of degrees	
40:43		furthermore is	
40:45		necessary to carry all significant	
40:47		digits in this calculation	
40:49		therefore you should use register or	
40:52		stack arithmetic now that we have the	
40:56		longitude of our station we are left	
40:58		with the problem of figuring its	
41:00		latitude similar to the direct	
41:03		conversion we need to use the mapping	
41:05		radius through our station while	
41:07		calculating the latitude this	
41:10		necessitates our use of the radial	
41:12		difference noted as you unless	
41:16		projection tables are available we won't	
41:19		proceed for now as if no projection	
41:20		tables are available first we will	
41:24		calculate the radial difference you in	
41:28		this equation we seek the value of the	
41:31		radial difference between the mapping	
41:33		radius of the central parallel and the	
41:36		mapping radius through the station in	
41:37		question first the difference in the	
41:40		eastings between the station and	
41:41		northing axis e sub o is multiplied by	
41:45		the tangent of half the station's planed	
41:48		convergence angle we then subtract the	
41:51		result from the difference between the	
41:54		northing of the station noted small N	
41:56		and the northing of the projection	
41:58		origin a tabled constant note is n sub o	
42:02		giving us u next we must use the radial	
42:06		difference to compute the latitude of	
42:08		the station G polynomial coefficients	
42:11		are used for inverse computation after	
42:16		the radial distance has been calculated	
42:18		G polynomial coefficients are used in	
42:21		algebra algebraic equations to calculate	
42:24		the difference between the latitude of	
42:26		the station and that of the projection	
42:29		origin the equation then adds the length	
42:32		to the latitude of the projection origin	
42:35		and thereby we we receive the latitude	
42:39		of the station either one of these	
42:42		equations may be used to calculate the	
42:44		latitude of the station using the	
42:46		previously calculated value for you and	
42:49		multiplying it by the G polynomial	
42:52		coefficients tabled constants for each	
42:55		zone the various portions of the	
42:58		solution	
42:58		must be	
42:59		carefully solved and then combined	
43:01		taking care with arithmetic signs and	
43:05		obtaining the latitude of the station if	
43:08		working on the calculator computing only	
43:12		0 significant digits such as the HP	
43:14		forty one it is necessary when adding	
43:17		latitudes to truncate tens of degrees if	
43:22		projection tables are used the latitude	
43:25		must be obtained by interpolation the	
43:28		interpolation argues mapping radius	
43:30		against latitude the mapping radius may	
43:34		be calculated from the following	
43:35		equation you may recognize the	
43:40		Pythagorean theorem in this equation	
43:42		this equation takes the square of the	
43:45		leg of the conversion triangle comprised	
43:48		of the difference of eastings adds to it	
43:51		the square of the leg of the conversion	
43:54		triangle comprised of the difference of	
43:55		northings and then takes its square root	
43:58		yielding the hypotenuse of the giant	
44:01		triangle which is the mapping radius	
44:03		through the station all terms on the	
44:07		right side of the equation are tabled	
44:09		zone constants except the northing and	
44:11		easting of the station when using	
44:15		projection tables the mapping radius	
44:18		just calculated is used as an argument	
44:21		against latitude the mapping radius	
44:25		isn't interpolated to refine the	
44:29		latitude of the station we've been at	
44:33		this for quite a while now and we have	
44:35		finished our discussion of inverse	
44:37		computation so let's take a short break	
44:48		welcome back to our discussion of state	
44:51		plane coordinates we will begin with	
44:54		adjustments to observations first we	
44:57		will deal with asthma's on the screen we	
45:01		see the central meridian or northern	
45:03		axis running north-south is labeled a	
45:07		sub o the notation for its easting which	
45:10		is a constant for each zone we also see	
45:13		the easting axis labeled n sub B which	
45:17		is the notation of its northing also a	
45:19		constant on the screen now a station has	
45:24		been added now a geodetic Meridian that	
45:28		is a geodetic North line has drawn	
45:30		between the station and the apex of the	
45:33		cone this meridian is the line of	
45:36		geodetic longitude through the station	
45:39		we now see a line running from our	
45:42		station toward another station it is	
45:45		easterly of us in this case the grid	
45:50		asmath of the line to the station is	
45:52		desired now shown as an angle labeled	
45:57		alpha this angle identifies the geodetic	
46:01		asmath the geodetic azimuth of the line	
46:04		toward the second station as two	
46:06		clockwise angle from the geodetic	
46:08		meridian around to the line to the	
46:12		second station for the california	
46:16		coordinate system of 1983 geodetic	
46:19		azmuth is reckoned from north not south	
46:22		as previously done on the screen now a	
46:27		grid North line through the station has	
46:29		been added because it is grid north it	
46:32		is parallel with the northern axis of	
46:34		the grid now we see the plane	
46:38		convergence angle labeled gamma at our	
46:41		station between geodetic north and grid	
46:44		north in this case convergence is	
46:48		negative because the station is west of	
46:50		the central Meridian if it had been east	
46:53		of the central Meridian that would have	
46:55		had a positive value be careful with	
46:58		arithmetic signs	
46:59		plain convergence angle as some call	
47:02		sometimes called the mapping angle we	
47:06		now see the addition of an angler	
47:08		dimension small T this quantity is the	
47:13		grid asmath of the line between our	
47:16		station and the one easterly of it grid	
47:20		azmuth is the clockwise angle at a	
47:23		station between the grid meridian that	
47:26		is grid north and the grid line to the	
47:28		other station next we see the equation T	
47:34		equals alpha minus gamma plus Delta	
47:39		bearing in mind that plain convergence	
47:42		angle and our drawing has a negative	
47:43		value inspection of the drawing	
47:46		demonstrates that T is equal to geodetic	
47:50		azmuth - plane convergence the other	
47:55		term in the general formula is neglected	
47:57		here it is variously named often arctic	
48:02		chord correction or second term	
48:05		correction there's usually minut but may	
48:08		need to be considered for high-quality	
48:10		work over long lines this presentation	
48:14		neglects it for CCS 83 both Judaic and	
48:20		grid Asmus are reckoned from north in	
48:23		verses between stations having state	
48:25		plane coordinates give grid azmuth and	
48:28		may be used directly for calculations on	
48:31		the grid plane convergence angles vary	
48:35		with longitude therefore we must specify	
48:38		the station where the convergence was	
48:40		determined when quoting it on a map	
48:44		plane convergence may be determined in	
48:47		two ways where the longitude is not	
48:50		known without calculation plane	
48:53		convergence can be calculated using the	
48:55		tabled constants of the zone and the	
48:58		plane coordinates this is the same	
49:02		equation that we saw earlier in the	
49:04		inverse computation ISA Bo the easting	
49:07		of the grid origin is subtracted from	
49:10		the easting of the station small e	
49:12		this yields the difference in eastings	
49:16		then dividing the eastings difference by	
49:19		the sum of R sub B the mapping radius of	
49:21		the grid base and n sub B the northing	
49:25		of the grid base blessed the northing of	
49:27		the station this is the other leg of the	
49:32		triangle these two quantities are the	
49:36		opposite and adjacent legs of the large	
49:38		conversion triangle they're arctangent	
49:41		yields the plane convergence angle if	
49:45		plane coordinates are not known but the	
49:48		longitude of the station is known the	
49:53		plane convergence may be calculated	
49:54		using the difference in longitude	
49:56		between the central meridian and the	
49:59		station which is a constant B sub o to	
50:06		calculate the plane convergence angle we	
50:10		use the equation displayed on the screen	
50:12		it determines the difference between the	
50:17		longitude of the central Meridian a	
50:19		tabled constant and the west longitude	
50:22		through the station it then proportions	
50:26		that difference using sine B sub o a	
50:29		tabled constant this is the same	
50:32		relationship that the central angle of	
50:34		the developed cone has to 360 degrees of	
50:38		longitude as mentioned previously after	
50:42		using the calculator having only ten	
50:44		significant digits such as the HP forty	
50:47		one it is necessary when subtracting	
50:50		longitudes in this equation to truncate	
50:52		tens and hundreds of degrees furthermore	
50:56		it is necessary to carry all significant	
50:59		digits for this calculation therefore	
51:02		use register or stack arithmetic the	
51:07		last element of grid azmuth is the	
51:09		second term or arctic chord correction	
51:12		the Lambert system is called conformal	
51:15		because it is a intended that field	
51:18		angles and grid angles should be	
51:20		identical they nearly are the second	
51:24		term correction is usually	
51:26		nute thanks being neglected for most	
51:28		courses under five miles long it is the	
51:32		difference between the grid asmath and	
51:34		the projected geodetic azmuth	
51:37		it increases directly with the change of	
51:40		eastings of a line and with the distance	
51:43		of the occupied station from the central	
51:45		parallel figuring it is neglected in	
51:49		this presentation this is the equation	
51:53		previously seen at the end of the	
51:55		graphics presentation of Asmus it states	
51:59		the basic relationship that grid asmath	
52:02		that small t equals the geodetic azmuth	
52:05		alpha - the plain convergence angle	
52:09		gamma plus the second term correction	
52:12		Delta we have now finished our treatment	
52:16		of asthma so we will next consider the	
52:20		treatment of distances converting them	
52:23		from the ground surface where they were	
52:25		measured to their ultimate destination	
52:27		the plane surface of the grid this	
52:31		product takes the this process takes the	
52:34		distance over several surfaces it	
52:37		originates at the ground surface the	
52:40		process then takes it through the	
52:42		surface of what is called the geoid the	
52:46		geoid is a gravity surface that has an	
52:48		equal potential this surface is	
52:51		analogous to the idea of mean sea level	
52:54		however unlike the common notion of mean	
52:58		sea level as a uniform surface smoothly	
53:05		curving like an ellipsoid the geoid	
53:08		curves up and down or undulates these	
53:11		changes usually occur gradually but	
53:14		nonetheless are significant over long	
53:16		distances the next surface involved in	
53:20		our process is the geodetic or	
53:22		ellipsoidal surface of the GRS 80	
53:25		ellipsoid the separation between the	
53:28		ellipsoid and the geoid	
53:30		is considered for the California	
53:32		coordinate system of 1983 this is a new	
53:36		process the older state plane chord	
53:40		system did not consider this separation	
53:42		because for the most part it could not	
53:45		be readily quantified the final surface	
53:49		that we go to is the surface of the cone	
53:52		which is in fact the plain surface of	
53:55		the grid on the screen a ground surface	
54:00		is shown for our present purposes it has	
54:03		an elevation significantly above sea	
54:05		level	
54:07		now another surface is added it is the	
54:11		surface of the geoid practically	
54:13		speaking this is the surface that serves	
54:16		as the datum for elevations in other	
54:18		words mean sea level the dimension	
54:21		between the geoid surface and our ground	
54:24		surface is labeled H we commonly know	
54:28		this distance is elevation next we see	
54:33		the addition of a third surface the	
54:35		surface of the GRS eighty ellipsoid in	
54:38		this illustration that lies above the	
54:41		geoid or sea level surface this is the	
54:44		case for all 48 contiguous states the	
54:49		distance at a station from the geoid to	
54:51		the ellipsoid is called geoid separation	
54:54		or geoid height and noted by capital n	
55:00		for the contiguous 48 states geoid	
55:03		separation has a negative value because	
55:06		the geoid is below the ellipsoid now on	
55:11		the screen we see another dimension has	
55:13		been added this is a lips Idol or	
55:16		geodetic height noted as small H it is	
55:22		elevation using the ellipsoid for its	
55:24		datum remembering that in our	
55:29		illustration capital n has a negative	
55:32		value it is apparent by inspection that	
55:36		small h equals capital n plus large age	
55:41		this relationship is now shown on the	
55:44		screen now a horizontal measured	
55:48		distance at ground level is added this	
55:51		distance is a chord and is	
55:53		noted as capital D lines are extended	
55:57		normal to the surface of the ellipsoid	
55:59		they converge towards the center of the	
56:02		ellipsoid now on the screen we see that	
56:06		when a ground surface chord distance is	
56:10		reduced to a chord distance on the	
56:12		ellipsoid surface the ellipsoidal	
56:15		chordless differs from the chord	
56:18		distance at ground level the notation L	
56:21		sub C indicates ellipsoidal cordless if	
56:26		ground length is above the ellipsoid	
56:28		surface as in this case the ellipsoidal	
56:31		cordless is shorter if ground surface is	
56:34		below the ellipsoid like along the	
56:36		Pacific Shore Death Valley and Imperial	
56:40		Valley the ellipsoidal cordless is	
56:42		longer than the ground length the	
56:46		movement of the length through the geoid	
56:48		is embedded in the equations used in	
56:51		this example and is not a separate	
56:54		procedure next we see the addition of	
56:59		the geodetic surface noted s the	
57:03		geodetic distance occurs on the geotag	
57:05		surface that is the surface of the	
57:08		ellipsoid it is an arc rather than a	
57:12		chord it is the jus the geodetic length	
57:16		is projected onto the cone the cone	
57:19		surface is not shown in our illustration	
57:21		but may be located either above or below	
57:24		the ellipsoidal surface this depends on	
57:28		whether the line is between the exact	
57:30		scale parallels or outside them it also	
57:34		could cost one or both of them the line	
57:37		is projected onto the cone surface by	
57:40		lines normal to the ellipsoid geodetic	
57:44		lines between the exact scale parallels	
57:46		shrink when projected onto the cone	
57:49		while lines outside the exact scale	
57:51		parallels get longer after the line has	
57:55		been projected onto the cone its length	
57:57		is a grid length that is is the distance	
58:01		between points on the grid we begin our	
58:05		conversion of measured distance to grid	
58:08		distance by calculating the radius of	
58:11		curvature of the ellipsoid because the	
58:14		ellipsoid is flattened at its poles the	
58:17		radius of curvature is uniform only	
58:19		along the equator except along the	
58:23		equator the radius of curvature will	
58:25		vary as the azimuth of the line varies	
58:28		and also as one travels along the line	
58:34		because it varies with azmuth the	
58:38		full-name is the radius of curvature in	
58:40		the azmuth there are complex equations	
58:44		for calculating precise values for this	
58:46		radius an approximate radius for each	
58:49		zone is the geometric geometric mean	
58:52		radius of curvature at the projection	
58:54		origin it is close enough for all but	
58:57		the most precise work that can be	
58:59		obtained by the following equation this	
59:04		equation states that an approximate rays	
59:07		of curvature in the azmuth noted as r	
59:10		sub alpha plus or minus may be	
59:13		calculated by dividing the geometric	
59:16		mean radius of the ellipsoid at the	
59:18		projection origin scaled to the grid a	
59:21		tabled constant doted small R sub O by	
59:26		the grid scale factor of the central	
59:28		parallel which is small K sub o this	
59:34		calculation yields the geometric mean	
59:37		radius of curvature of the ellipsoid at	
59:40		the projection origin using this	
59:43		approximate radius of curvature of the	
59:45		ellipsoid will we'll next calculate the	
59:48		ellipsoidal reduction factor also known	
59:51		as the elevation factor the value just	
59:56		obtained for the approximate rays of	
59:58		curvature is now used in the upper	
60:01		equation on the screen to figure an	
60:03		ellipsoidal reduction factor noted as R	
60:06		sub e calculate the reduction factor by	
60:11		dividing the approximate radius of	
60:13		curvature by the sum of the approximate	
60:17		radius the geodetic separation noted is	
60:20		Capital n and the elevation to which the	
60:23		measured line was reduced noted by	
60:25		capital H this equation in effect	
60:30		develops proportion between two radii	
60:32		the first is the radius of the ellipsoid	
60:34		at the station the other is the radius	
60:38		at the ground elevation of the station	
60:40		this is similar to route surveys where	
60:44		the centerline cord lengths of a curve	
60:46		may be scaled to an offset by using the	
60:49		ratio of the centreline radius and the	
60:52		offset radius the ellipsoidal cordless	
60:57		noted L sub C can be calculated by	
61:01		multiplying the ellipsoidal reduction	
61:03		factor times the ground level horizontal	
61:06		measured distance noted capital D this	
61:11		is shown in the second the lower	
61:12		equation on the screen this ellipsoidal	
61:16		cordless is a straight-line distance	
61:18		between two points on the surface of the	
61:21		ellipsoid it is not a distance measured	
61:24		on the surface of the lip side which	
61:26		would be an arc length called a geodetic	
61:29		length the elevation used for the	
61:33		measured line is usually one of the	
61:34		following for triangulation it is the	
61:38		average elevation of the base line for	
61:41		electronic distance measuring devices it	
61:44		is the elevation to which the slope	
61:46		length was reduced this is usually the	
61:49		elevation of the instrument or the	
61:51		elevation of the station mark for tape	
61:55		lines is usually the average elevation	
61:57		of the line each one meter air and the	
62:02		geoid separation or elevation	
62:04		contributes 0.16 parts per million of	
62:08		air to the distance often geoid	
62:10		separation can be estimated for stations	
62:13		in the general area based upon published	
62:16		values for nearby stations the value of	
62:20		capital n usually does not vary greatly	
62:23		in a given area examining the variations	
62:27		in the proximity of your work can aid in	
62:30		determining if anomalies exist in the	
62:32		area	
62:33		if precise geodetic lengths are desired	
62:37		a correction from ellipsoidal cordless	
62:40		to geodetic length on the ellipsoid	
62:42		surface may be applied to lines	
62:45		generally greater than 5 miles long	
62:48		shorter lines and lines measured in	
62:51		segments are essentially arcs and need	
62:54		not be corrected the ellipsoidal	
62:56		cordless but must be nearly nine miles	
62:59		before the correction equals 1/100 of a	
63:02		foot and over 19 miles before it equals	
63:06		/10 of a foot the upper equation on the	
63:12		screen is for calculating the chord	
63:15		correction for lengthening the	
63:17		ellipsoidal cordless to the geodetic	
63:20		length remember that arcs are always	
63:23		longer than their chords you may	
63:26		recognize this equation from route	
63:27		surveying the equation calculates the	
63:31		chord correction by cubing the	
63:34		ellipsoidal cordless and then dividing	
63:37		it by 24 times the square of the radius	
63:40		of curvature in the azmuth as shown by	
63:45		the lower equation after determining the	
63:48		chord correction the correction is added	
63:51		to the ellipsoidal cordless yielding the	
63:54		geodetic length noted as s once we have	
63:59		calculated the geodetic length of the	
64:01		line it must be projected onto the cone	
64:04		grid length is calculated by multiplying	
64:07		the geodetic length by a grid scale	
64:11		factor grid scale factors an expression	
64:14		of the amount of distortion imposed on	
64:16		the length of a line from the ellipsoid	
64:19		as it is projected onto the grid cone is	
64:23		represented by the small letter K scale	
64:27		factor is the ratio of the length of the	
64:30		grid on the grid to the length on the	
64:32		ellipsoid scale factor is dependent upon	
64:35		latitude it is less than unity between	
64:39		the standard parallels and greater than	
64:42		unity outside them	
64:44		scale factors can be calculated for	
64:47		points or for lines for this	
64:50		presentation point scale factors are	
64:52		used exclusively if greater accuracy is	
64:56		needed for a long line the point scale	
64:59		factor for the midpoint may be used	
65:02		approximate point scale factors may be	
65:05		interpolated from projection tables a	
65:08		method precise enough for any plane	
65:10		coordinate work uses polynomial	
65:13		coefficients we must first find the	
65:16		value of the radial distance discuss	
65:18		preview previously and noted as small U	
65:22		if plane coordinates are known this	
65:25		equation can be used to find the radial	
65:29		difference this is similar to another	
65:34		equation we saw earlier you may	
65:37		recognize the Pythagorean theorem in	
65:39		this equation this equation takes the	
65:42		square of the leg of the conversion	
65:45		triangle comprised of the difference in	
65:47		eastings from the central meridian to	
65:51		the station adds it to the square of the	
65:53		leg of the giant triangle comprised of	
65:55		difference of northings then takes the	
65:58		square root of their sum yielding the	
66:01		hypotenuse of the conversion triangle	
66:03		which is the mapping radius through the	
66:06		station that mapping radius through the	
66:09		station is then subtracted from the map	
66:12		mapping radius of the projection origin	
66:14		to obtain the radial difference if	
66:18		geodetic latitude for the line is known	
66:21		the following equations can be used to	
66:24		calculate the radial difference we have	
66:27		seen them before during our discussion	
66:29		on forward computation this equation	
66:33		takes the north latitude of the station	
66:36		noted as B and subtracts the latitude of	
66:40		projection origin the central parallel a	
66:44		tabled constant noted as B sub o it	
66:47		yields the difference in latitude	
66:52		if working on a calculator computing	
66:56		only ten significant digits such as the	
66:58		HP forty one it is necessary when	
67:02		subtracting latitudes to turn kate tens	
67:05		of degrees using the latitude difference	
67:10		just obtained we enter it into either	
67:14		equation now displayed to calculate the	
67:16		value of u using polynomial coefficients	
67:19		some persons feel that the second	
67:23		equation is easier for handheld solution	
67:25		because it has a nested form be careful	
67:29		to keep track of arithmetic signs the	
67:32		radial difference u has a positive value	
67:34		if the station lies northerly of the	
67:36		central parallel and negative value if	
67:40		it lies southerly once we have	
67:43		calculated the radial difference by one	
67:46		of the equations we have just seen we	
67:49		can use it to calculate the point scale	
67:52		factor using polynomial coefficients the	
68:00		value calculated above for the radial	
68:02		distance U and the tabled F polynomial	
68:05		coefficients can be used in the equation	
68:07		shown on the monitor to calculate a	
68:10		point scale factor noted as small K	
68:14		approximate scale factors for points may	
68:18		also be found in projection tables the	
68:21		latitude or mapping radius through the	
68:23		station is argued against scale factor	
68:26		the immediate values are interpolated	
68:30		next we use the point scale factor just	
68:33		found to project our geodetic length	
68:36		onto the grid this will give us its grid	
68:39		length the grid length L sub grid is	
68:44		calculated by multiplying the point	
68:47		scale factor K together with the	
68:50		geodetic length of the line small s if	
68:54		no correction from ellipse ellipsoidal	
68:57		cordless the geodetic length is	
68:59		warranted and the latitude and elevation	
69:02		differences are not great measured	
69:05		lengths may be more	
69:06		applied by a combined factor to	
69:08		calculate grid lengths using a value for	
69:11		average elevation and average latitude	
69:15		the upper equation states that we can	
69:18		calculate a combined factor noted CF by	
69:22		multiplying an average lips idle	
69:25		reduction factor r sub e by a point	
69:28		scale factor calculated for the mid	
69:30		latitude of survey noted small K the	
69:36		lower equation shows that once we have	
69:38		determined the combined factor we can	
69:41		multiply each ground level horizontal	
69:44		measured length noted capital D by it to	
69:48		calculate each courses grid length grid	
69:53		length may be converted to ground	
69:55		lengths by reversing the above	
69:57		procedures for measurements of similar	
70:00		elevation latitude in short length	
70:02		ground lengths may be calculated by	
70:05		dividing a combined factor into the grid	
70:08		length in dealing with areas calculated	
70:14		on a grid the areas derived from stink	
70:18		plane coordinates must be corrected if	
70:21		ground level areas are desired the	
70:25		equation shown on the screen may be used	
70:27		to correct grid area to ground area it	
70:31		shows that the ground level area of the	
70:33		land may be computed by dividing the	
70:36		grid area of the figure by the square of	
70:39		the combined scale factor in effect this	
70:42		applies the combined factor to both the	
70:45		length and the width of the figure a	
70:50		problem arrives arises in converting	
70:53		coordinates from one zone to another to	
70:57		convert plane coordinates in the overlap	
70:59		of zones from one zone to another	
71:01		convert the plane coordinates from the	
71:04		original zone using the constants for	
71:06		that zone to geodetic latitude and	
71:09		longitude then using the coordinates for	
71:12		the new zone convert the geodetic	
71:15		latitude and longitude to the plane	
71:17		coordinates in the new	
71:21		as enacted by the California Legislature	
71:26		Lennear units may be expressed either in	
71:29		meters or in your u.s. survey feet plane	
71:33		coordinates or distances expressed in	
71:35		meters or feet can be converted to the	
71:38		other unit simply by multiplying the	
71:40		northern and eastern or the measurement	
71:43		by the u.s. survey foot to international	
71:46		meter equivalency shown on the screen	
71:51		the u.s. survey foot is a length the	
71:55		linear unit of the UN of the California	
71:57		coordinate system is defined as one u.s.	
72:01		survey foot equals 1,200 divided by 3937	
72:07		international meters it is the	
72:10		specialized foot that is used in	
72:13		surveying when first using functions in	
72:17		a calculator or computer to convert	
72:19		between feet and meters you should test	
72:22		to ensure that the correct conversion	
72:24		factor is employed you should test you	
72:28		should test it by using the machine's	
72:30		functions to convert exactly 3937 feet	
72:36		to meters the result should be exactly	
72:40		,200 meters the reverse must also be	
72:44		true comparing the result while	
72:47		displaying the maximum decimal places	
72:49		should tell you whether the conversion	
72:51		you you are using is for us survey foot	
72:55		one may work the California coordinate	
72:58		system and either feet or in meters	
73:01		however one must be consistent not only	
73:04		must all distances and coordinates be	
73:07		uniformly in feet or in meters	
73:09		but tabled constants must also	
73:11		correspond with the linear units close	
73:14		Showzen I hope that this presentation	
73:17		will help you in your understanding of	
73:20		the state plane coordinate system I also	
73:23		encourage you to study hard and prepare	
73:25		well for your land surveying examination	
73:27		I wish you the best of luck and success	
73:31		thank you
