00:36		those in this course of word book but	
00:39		problems from other sources as well this	
00:43		course is funded by Caltrans but you and	
00:46		i will a profound of thanks to others	
00:48		the courses and stalked towards from the	
00:51		academic community the private sector	
00:53		other public agencies and from Caltrans	
00:56		as well we wish you well in your study	
01:00		for becoming a member of california's	
01:02		professional land surveying community	
01:08		the Federal I'm look for food I'm a	
01:11		lighting plan to there in the state of	
01:13		California my number is LF 4213 I'm	
01:18		semi-retired Caltrans land surveyors	
01:21		currently involved with the caltrain	
01:23		training class known as the trilogy my	
01:27		land surveying experience with Caltrans	
01:29		was about equally divided between	
01:31		surveys and right away engineering while	
01:34		I was in right away engineering I had	
01:37		charge of a squad that did nothing but	
01:39		right legal descriptions that brought me	
01:43		into constant touch with Ray wages	
01:45		attorneys title company personnel as	
01:48		well as purveyors I have also had some	
01:52		experience in the private sector where I	
01:54		did a few parcel map and some other	
01:56		small survey I'm going to talk to you	
01:59		about legal description a legal	
02:03		description in the word picture that	
02:06		actually and accurately described a	
02:09		parcel of land the way good models in	
02:14		his excellent book ray legal decisions	
02:17		of the following about them a	
02:23		description of the outline of a certain	
02:27		area is the top of looping of words that	
02:30		delineate one specific piece of land and	
02:33		which cannot apply to any other piece of	
02:36		land although the definition is	
02:38		correctly stated as land decision it is	
02:42		generally called legal because it must	
02:45		stand up under the law and litigation a	
02:51		typical description usually include	
02:55		preamble or caption the body and	
02:59		qualifying or augmenting club the first	
03:03		two are sometimes combined in one short	
03:06		paragraph they are frequently no	
03:08		qualifying on all many clauses needed a	
03:13		good legal description	
03:15		has the following characteristics it's	
03:18		capable of only one anticipation is	
03:21		short but clear if available is legal	
03:26		and it insurable let's take a look at	
03:30		these points one at a time capable of	
03:33		only one interpretation all of us use	
03:37		words in ordinary conversation that has	
03:40		vastly different meanings to different	
03:41		people words like mostly somewhat	
03:46		generally and so forth are they for	
03:50		instance what does generally mean does	
03:52		it mean fifty percent of the time	
03:54		seventy-five percent of the time or	
03:57		something else would like to have the	
04:00		equation in general conversation but do	
04:03		not fit in legal descriptions terms like	
04:07		more or less are sometimes found in	
04:10		legal descriptions but they are always	
04:13		accompanied by another more precise	
04:16		statement that is intended to control	
04:20		knowledgeable people in the fields of	
04:22		land surveying and title work must agree	
04:25		on the anticipation if there is	
04:28		disagreement among professionals as to	
04:30		the meaning of words or techniques use	
04:32		the writers must look for a different	
04:35		way of saying what he or she wanted to	
04:38		say you may have your own pet way of	
04:41		saying something and it may even stand	
04:43		up in court but if other professionals	
04:47		in the field are divided in their	
04:49		interpretations of what you said you	
04:53		really ought to change your style and	
04:55		technique in a way that will result in	
04:58		descriptions that are capable of only	
05:00		one interpretation short the description	
05:06		should be short consistent with clarity	
05:10		where they must not be sacrificed	
05:13		ability however it must clearly describe	
05:17		the parcel but on the other hand on this	
05:20		language must be avoided after all the	
05:24		more worthy a document is the more	
05:27		chances there are four errors survey	
05:31		about it must be available the purveyor	
05:36		begins with monuments on the ground if	
05:39		there are none at all on the perimeter	
05:41		of the subject part fold the surveyor	
05:44		must find monument somewhere and what is	
05:47		our way into the parcel that means that	
05:51		proper writing techniques must be used	
05:54		to make sure that the decision will be	
05:57		oriented in the correct manner so that	
06:00		the parcel can be marked out on the	
06:02		ground where the writer intended that	
06:04		can be done if the writer is familiar	
06:09		with the proven techniques that are	
06:11		available to us it is particularly	
06:14		important that decisions are included	
06:16		free line calls or new property lines be	
06:20		written in such a way that the new line	
06:23		can be surveyed and monumental would	
06:25		confidence with no chance of someone	
06:28		later proving that the line should be	
06:31		placed in another position there are a	
06:34		number of techniques available that can	
06:36		assist in reaching this goal we'll	
06:38		examine some shortly legal it must be	
06:44		able to stand up in court if necessary	
06:47		in other words the writer must use words	
06:50		and techniques in the way in which a	
06:53		court of law will understand them there	
06:56		is frequently a great difference between	
06:59		the legal definition of the word and the	
07:02		general public understanding of what it	
07:04		means and the writer must be aware of	
07:08		the differences insurable title	
07:15		companies issue insurance on	
07:17		descriptions stating among other things	
07:19		that it does not conflict with decisions	
07:22		of adjoining parcels if title	
07:26		in person all things that are	
07:27		description is poorly written and may	
07:30		not be able to stand the legal test in	
07:32		court they are not likely to ensure that	
07:36		insurability standard is a higher	
07:38		standard than just being legal the title	
07:42		person is not likely to ensure the	
07:44		decision unless it is clearly legal and	
07:48		not borderline writers who are really	
07:54		successful invariably have certain basic	
07:58		qualifications they usually once	
08:02		understand Bali determination principles	
08:05		to understand the legal meaning of words	
08:09		used and three understand accepted brain	
08:13		techniques let's take a look at them one	
08:17		at a time number one understand bounder	
08:21		determination principles it is	
08:24		impossible to be a good description	
08:26		writers without a good understanding of	
08:29		bounded determination principles it is	
08:31		not uncommon to find two or more	
08:34		monuments each purporting to mark the	
08:36		location of one corner the writer must	
08:39		be in the habit of checking the pedigree	
08:42		of each monument found if the pedigree	
08:46		is good it can be traced back to the	
08:49		original monument if some kind of	
08:52		monument is found somewhere near where	
08:53		the corner is thought to be but the	
08:56		monument cannot be traced back to the	
08:58		original the writer really doesn't know	
09:01		where the corner is the writer must	
09:05		recognize and accept that fact and use a	
09:08		technique that will allow for it number	
09:12		two understand the legal meaning of	
09:16		any description may end up in court at	
09:19		some time if in when it does the court	
09:24		will interpret it based on the legally	
09:26		accepted definition of woods views	
09:29		whether the writer understood them that	
09:31		way or not get in the habit of looking	
09:34		up words in the dictionary and please	
09:37		don't use a dime-store dictionaries use	
09:40		a good legal dictionary like black's law	
09:43		dictionary or the title handbook you'll	
09:47		find weapons to them in your workbook	
09:50		number three understand accepted writing	
09:54		techniques in communicating with any	
09:58		group the writer or speakers must	
10:01		understand the language and thinking of	
10:03		visitor listeners one goal of the person	
10:06		writing legal decisions is to convince	
10:09		his or her fellow professionals those	
10:13		professionals have developed a language	
10:15		and certain writing techniques all their	
10:17		own it is vital that we understand them	
10:20		and learn to use them decisions we write	
10:24		will be more readily accepted by them if	
10:29		we use procedures and techniques they	
10:32		are familiar with now the writers frame	
10:37		of mind right as all three people	
10:43		representing three different professions	
10:45		were looking over your shoulder those	
10:48		three are one the surveyor to the title	
10:53		person and breathe the judge each has a	
10:58		unique special interest in the	
11:01		description now let's take a look at	
11:04		each of these points of view one the	
11:09		surveyor is interested in a place to	
11:11		start in the field a way to orient the	
11:14		bearings in the decision and enough	
11:16		information to allow him over	
11:18		calculator travelers to it and just take	
11:21		it out in the field the typical surveyor	
11:24		is intensely interested in the problem	
11:27		of locating the particle on the ground	
11:30		but is frequently not well acquainted	
11:33		with the title person's problems and	
11:36		confirmed number two the title person is	
11:41		concerned with ensuring the description	
11:44		and therefore watches hopefully the call	
11:47		to and along existing property lines the	
11:52		typical title party knows little about	
11:54		the rain but is very concerned about the	
11:58		distant relationship to adjoining	
12:01		parcels the air the typical surveyor is	
12:05		likely to make is failing to make	
12:09		appropriate title called number three	
12:14		the judge of course is interested in the	
12:17		bottom line will it stand the test in	
12:20		court the judge is also keenly aware of	
12:24		the exact legal mean of the words used	
12:27		in the desciption and here again the	
12:30		average surveyor has a tendency to use	
12:33		terms without understanding clearly how	
12:37		a court of law may understand them do	
12:40		yourself a favor and get in the habit of	
12:43		using the same that canary the judge you	
12:56		you'll find a list of times in your	
12:59		workbook that are encountered in legal	
13:01		description they could be studied and	
13:03		understood early again the book you use	
13:07		to include the ones you'll find in the	
13:09		recommended reading in your workbook	
13:12		special attention should be given to	
13:14		words like pedigree and have we have	
13:18		already talked about pedigree the words	
13:21		have as two different meanings depending	
13:24		on how to use under state rules past	
13:29		main area but if federal rules are to be	
13:33		followed the word means dividing the	
13:35		sideline dimensions in half and then	
13:38		connecting the midpoint that rarely	
13:41		results in half by area half in a	
13:45		description in California news area on	
13:48		left the decision includes language that	
13:52		clearly indicates that the intent is to	
13:54		use federal rules such as a reference to	
13:58		the US government survey either is a	
14:02		commonly abused word it means on one	
14:06		side or the other and that is almost	
14:09		never what the decision right along to	
14:12		say begin is sometimes described the	
14:15		strip of land by paying a tipple and 20	
14:18		feet wide line 10 feet on either side of	
14:21		the following the sideline that	
14:25		statement decides a template wide strip	
14:27		on one side or on the other of the	
14:31		decide line the one should be each and	
14:35		not either it's hard to imagine the was	
14:38		either ever fitting in a legal decision	
14:42		adjacent adjoining and continuous should	
14:47		be understood also an easement that	
14:50		touches the property of the line along	
14:53		its entire length is said to be	
14:54		adjoining whereas an easement of	
14:57		the property line for part of the plane	
15:00		and for the rest of the length is close	
15:02		to but not touching they're said to be	
15:05		adjacent adjoining or adjacent was	
15:11		described that portion that touches the	
15:13		property line but adjacent is the only	
15:16		word that describes that portion of the	
15:19		human that is close to but not touching	
15:22		the property line learn what the various	
15:26		authorities say about the word	
15:28		contiguous and you will agree that it is	
15:31		an ambiguous term it should be avoided	
15:34		in legal decisions accepting and	
15:38		reserving are sometimes used as though	
15:41		they were synonymous they are not accept	
15:46		or accepting have the effect of	
15:50		subtracting something from the parcel	
15:52		just described a decision that described	
15:55		they create a particle and then accept	
15:58		one acre convey two acres the eggs are	
16:04		described in the exception was taken	
16:07		back or removed from the created	
16:11		initially described reserved or	
16:16		reserving creates a new right like an	
16:19		easement print in favor of the grand for	
16:22		a DJ decide creators and then reserved	
16:26		to the grand for a 40-foot easement	
16:29		along the east property line for ingress	
16:32		and egress to serve another parcel owned	
16:35		by the dam for the dude tilton they	
16:38		created to the grantee but create them	
16:43		over the three acres in favor of the	
16:46		grand for the grand toy did not need the	
16:49		easement before because we are you own	
16:52		the entire parcel you'll find in your	
16:56		workbook instead of miscellaneous Claude	
17:00		designed to help you handle certain	
17:03		standard situations each of the candid	
17:06		the words that have been found to work	
17:10		well for describing certain lines like	
17:12		curves parallel lines calls the street	
17:16		side lines strips and so forth you may	
17:20		as well use the same standard statement	
17:22		it is simply not necessary or why to	
17:26		spend precious time trying to invent a	
17:28		way of saying certain things when	
17:31		experienced professionals have spent	
17:33		years perfecting the way the fair don't	
17:36		try to compose them from scratch while	
17:38		you were taking the test and don't try	
17:41		to memorize them there are simply too	
17:42		many rather index a number of samples	
17:47		from this and other sources so you can	
17:50		turn to them quickly and find the sample	
17:53		that is close to what you need then	
17:56		modify it to fit your situation that's	
17:59		much easier and a whole lot safer you'll	
18:03		find other samples of handy ways of	
18:06		saying certain things in the book listed	
18:08		under recommended reading particularly	
18:10		mature autos both waiting legal	
18:12		decisions which we have already	
18:13		mentioned concentrate on getting	
18:16		acquainted with the samples that are	
18:18		available and where and how to find them	
18:21		in a way that will make their worth much	
18:24		easier now let's go back to the basic	
18:30		outline of a description and take a look	
18:32		at the three components in some detail	
18:35		the preamble or captions describes the	
18:39		wiser farfel out of which the subject	
18:41		parcel is touch it serves to bring the	
18:44		readers	
18:45		attention to focus on the immediate	
18:46		surroundings after it could include the	
18:51		county city of any Anna Griffin	
18:56		subdivision such as section township and	
18:59		brains meriem or lock block and track it	
19:05		will include the names of the Grand Tour	
19:07		and the grantee and will normally	
19:10		indicate the degree of title convey	
19:12		foreign teams the firm grants to with no	
19:16		qualifying language and their faith	
19:20		whereas the statement grant to john	
19:23		jones and him and even for in japanese	
19:26		earth inin tube would grant an easement	
19:29		for that first there is an exception to	
19:34		what i have said and that'd a quitclaim	
19:36		deed the word the word grantor vampy	
19:41		grant to and such do not appear in foot	
19:44		wing beach and instead of hating the	
19:47		exact title conveyed it will use words	
19:50		like quit claim or reminds relief and	
19:54		quick claims a quickly indeed religions	
19:58		whatever interest designer had if any	
20:02		the preamble may include words that	
20:05		limit the conveyance such as that	
20:08		portion of lot 7 etc included within a	
20:11		strip of land the described script-based	
20:15		and far beyond the borders of lot 7 but	
20:20		the only portion convey will be the	
20:22		portion of the strip that falls within	
20:25		lock 7 the preamble may indicate the	
20:30		type of decision to follow such as a	
20:33		line description Norwich disposition now	
20:38		the body of the description this is	
20:41		where the particulars of the description	
20:43		are found most people when thinking of	
20:46		legal description think in terms	
20:49		of meat rebound decision where the	
20:51		description begins at a point on the	
20:53		perimeter of the powerful and then gives	
20:56		a series of bearings and distances	
20:58		around the farkle back to the point of	
21:01		beginning a great many descriptions are	
21:04		written that way but there are a number	
21:06		of other types that are really	
21:08		variations on this basic technique we'll	
21:11		see some examples of these different	
21:13		types shortly the firm metes and bounds	
21:17		need measurements and boundaries the	
21:22		bearings and distances constitute the	
21:24		beach and the bound or boundaries	
21:28		consist of the title calls that are made	
21:31		throughout the description it's obvious	
21:36		that a description must hold	
21:38		mathematically a typical metes and	
21:41		bounds description says that have	
21:44		returned to the point of beginning if	
21:46		the bearings and distances do not return	
21:49		the reader to the point of beginning	
21:51		everyone knows that a mistake had been	
21:54		made the fishing may even be void for	
21:58		one a certainty it's a good idea to run	
22:00		a Travis to a meeting bound decision	
22:03		once in written it will not help you	
22:06		with title cause what is indeed a very	
22:09		good feeling to know that the decision	
22:11		clothes Courtin are the statements used	
22:17		to describe the straight and curved	
22:19		lines that make up the boundary of the	
22:21		farkle the simple course and the one	
22:25		most of us are familiar with is the	
22:27		uncomplicated straight line Eric Illidan	
22:32		then south 60-degree need 55 point bill	
22:37		guilty then north 40 degree be 100 point	
22:42		bill hill feet the word dent is the	
22:46		word to use in the situation because it	
22:49		means in effect continuing from the	
22:52		previous court the reader is told to	
22:55		traverse in the direction south 50	
22:58		degrees e for a distance of 55 feet the	
23:03		reader again told to continue from that	
23:05		point north 40 degrees east for a	
23:08		difference of 100 feet comparing two	
23:13		bearing gives a deflection angle between	
23:15		two quarters in this case it would be 80	
23:19		degrees the leader needs that deflection	
23:23		angle in order to plot it in the office	
23:26		or to stake it out in the field now	
23:29		let's take a look at a description of	
23:31		the tangent serve that follows those to	
23:34		court tense equally along a tangent	
23:39		curve to the right having a radius of 50	
23:42		feet through a central angle of 80	
23:45		degrees in art distance of fifty nine	
23:47		point eighty one feet this statement	
23:51		describes the curve and its relationship	
23:53		to the preview course the word tangent	
23:57		defined the curve as being tangent to	
24:00		the premier court in other words	
24:03		original line to the point where the	
24:05		curb again is that right angle in the	
24:09		premium course the term to the right	
24:13		means that a person walking the line	
24:16		would curve to the right when walking	
24:19		from the street lined into the curve	
24:22		radius Delta and length of curve are all	
24:27		given all only two are needed to set the	
24:30		curve the third and given for tech note	
24:34		that the term are different	
24:36		is used to describe the length of curve	
24:38		to make sure that the reader does not	
24:41		assume that the distance should be	
24:43		measured along the court the technique	
24:47		we've just described is called the	
24:49		tangent method of describing a curve	
24:51		that is tangent to the previous court	
24:54		because it tests the curve relative to a	
24:57		tangent line that passes through the	
25:00		beginning of the curve some prefer	
25:03		another method called the concave method	
25:06		which uses the direction of concavity of	
25:09		the curve itself as well as the bearing	
25:12		of a radio line to the point where the	
25:14		curb again what do we mean by direction	
25:19		of concavity well mr. yourself have the	
25:23		midpoint of the curve and facing the	
25:26		radius point of the curve that is the	
25:29		center of a circle of which the curve is	
25:32		apart you were then looking in the	
25:35		direction of continuity in how the same	
25:39		curve would be described using the Conte	
25:42		of method to a tangent or concave cutter

25:50		bill bill beach then East to lead a long	
25:53		said curve to a central angle of 80	
25:56		degrees in art distance of sixty nine	
25:59		point eighty one feet in this drawing	
26:03		which theater that is not tangent to the	
26:06		previous course there is a different	
26:09		situation because the writer must give	
26:12		enough information and do it clearly	
26:15		enough so that the reader can run a	
26:17		traverse through need efficient without	
26:21		looking at a map what you'd both mess	
26:24		with both both methods to decide this	
26:27		non tangent curve first the tangent	
26:30		method north 40 degrees 100-point	
26:35		durability to a non tangent curve then	
26:39		Brahma tangent	
26:41		Baird North 50-degree II usually along a	
26:45		curve	
26:54		to the right having a radius of 50 point	
26:57		bill guilty to a central angle of a	
27:00		degree in art distance of fifty nine	
27:03		point eighty 13 this description starts	
27:08		right off by saying that the curve is	
27:10		not standard however if readers are to	
27:14		calculate traveling through deception or	
27:16		walk through in the field it will need	
27:19		to be oriented in the correct direction	
27:21		to preserve their for the next statement	
27:26		serve from a tangent that there are	
27:29		North 50 degrees deep that instruct	
27:33		readers to face North 50 degrees instead	
27:37		of north 40 degrees as they would have	
27:40		aged if the curve was handed to the	
27:42		previous course the rest of the	
27:45		description proceeds the same as if the	
27:47		curve were tangent i would take a look	
27:51		at the concave method from the beginning	
27:55		of a non tangent curve concave southerly	
27:58		and having a radius of 55 bill bill feet	
28:01		to which beginning of a radial line	
28:05		there is north 30 degrees west then	
28:08		easily along said verb through a central	
28:12		angle of 80 degrees in our distance of	
28:15		fifty nine point eighty one feet the	
28:19		unique feature that have been added to	
28:21		this decision is the statement to which	
28:24		beginning to observe a radial line bears	
28:27		North 30 degrees west this gives the	
28:31		reader the directions of gold to reach	
28:33		the radius point of the curve when the	
28:37		radius Delta and lang	
28:39		are given leader and one of the	
28:41		direction of travel the picture is	
28:44		complete note that the radial bearing	
28:48		given is north 30 degrees with and not	
28:51		south 30 degrees a radial line radiates	
28:56		in one direction from the radius point	
29:00		to the point on the curve and not beyond	
29:03		a prolongation of a radial line is	
29:07		described as just that a prolongation of	
29:11		a radial line in the door now on the	
29:16		screen we see a parcel consisting of	
29:18		five quarts all of them straight line	
29:21		two of them are title line in this day	
29:25		second-line that means their lines that	
29:28		exist on recorded maps or document and	
29:31		are locatable on the ground the	
29:34		description mark all along each of these	
29:37		lines to make sure that it does not	
29:39		overlap the line and encroach on	
29:43		adjoining property each of these two	
29:46		court must include two things first a	
29:50		bearing on distance and second a	
29:53		specific call along the section line	
29:57		certain bearing and/or differences in	
30:01		the decision must feel diff necessary in	
30:04		order that the decision will run along	
30:06		the section line the other three court	
30:10		to decide free lines that simply means	
30:14		that they are free of existing title	
30:16		lines admittedly some of them are more	
30:19		free than others for instance line bc is	
30:23		tied to the section line at be and why	
30:26		indeed	
30:27		is connected to the second line at me	
30:30		but the lines themselves are free they	
30:34		do not coincide with existing title line	
30:38		there are new property lines created by	
30:41		this decision let the fill that the	
30:46		decision begins at the second corner and	
30:48		goes clockwise around the park hold the	
30:52		person reading the description traces it	
30:54		out either on paper or on the ground by	
30:58		using the angles of intersection shown	
31:00		as G B D and E each angle each angle of	
31:07		intersection give derived by comparing	
31:10		the bearings of the two adjoining court	
31:13		though shown a b c and d are	
31:17		unchallenged but the angle of	
31:20		intersection I he must yield if	
31:22		necessary to match the true direction of	
31:25		the East line of affection that means	
31:28		trouble later on as will film feet	
31:39		in a description leading clockwise	
31:42		around the parcel the court from DC will	
31:46		include of course a bearing at a	
31:48		distance but it must also include a call	
31:51		to the east line of subsections that	
31:55		call must be made because the second	
31:58		line is the property line that tells the	
32:01		reader that the intent is to reach the	
32:03		hitch line even if the distance just	
32:06		given mark you incidentally if the court	
32:11		from dte give a bearing and a distance	
32:15		and added the statement to a point on	
32:18		the yeast line of objection distant	
32:21		northerly along penny blind twelve	
32:24		hundred and fourteen feet from the	
32:26		southeast corner subsection both the	
32:29		bearing and the distance given would	
32:31		have to you if necessary that is not	
32:35		just a call to align but a call to a	
32:38		specific point on the line and that	
32:41		called must be honored likewise the call	
32:46		may have given a bearing and distance	
32:48		and the statement to the southeast	
32:51		corner of dead sections here again the	
32:54		bearing and distance would both after	
32:56		you if necessary and the description	
32:58		would run directly to the second corner	
33:02		the course from e to the second corner	
33:06		should include a bearing and distance	
33:09		along with a call a long said section	
33:13		line to the section corner or to the	
33:16		point of beginning in this case of the	
33:20		bearing and the distance may have to	
33:22		yield note that using the bearings and	
33:25		distances alone an ignoring the title	
33:29		calls to and	
33:30		along the east line of the feckin may	
33:34		place this court in a location other	
33:36		than on the true East line of affection	
33:41		free lines must be described in such a	
33:45		way that they are available that means	
33:48		that they must be based on the strongest	
33:50		possible evidence which usually mean	
33:52		that the free line call should be	
33:54		established early in the decision if	
33:58		this description were written in a	
34:00		counterclockwise direction 30 half of	
34:03		section corner the free line calls would	
34:06		immediately follow the call along the	
34:09		East line of the section and be fed	
34:11		relative to the location of that East	
34:14		line however the location of that he's	
34:17		blind that is secure plot lines of the	
34:21		direction to go in this page now the	
34:26		point of beginning the description must	
34:29		pass a point of beginning that is a	
34:31		locatable record point or reference to	
34:35		one let's take a look at some possible	
34:38		choices in the joy now on the screen the	
34:42		preamble would read like this that	
34:45		portion a lot to block the tract 1124 in	
34:49		the city of county of day of california	
34:52		according to map recorded in book one	
34:54		hundred pages 16 and 17 of map in the	
34:57		office of the County Recorder of dead	
34:59		counties decide as follows then would	
35:03		follow the body of the deception which	
35:05		begins by describing the point of	
35:07		beginning one way to describe the	
35:11		highlighted portion of law to is to	
35:14		establish the point of beginning at a	
35:16		and then run clockwise around the	
35:19		parking that version would begin by	
35:22		saying beginning at the southwest corner	
35:24		of deadlock to another version would be	
35:29		to begin	
35:29		description as be reference to the	
35:32		northwest corner of lot to it might read	
35:36		like this to getting at a point on the	
35:39		west line of fed law two different there	
35:42		on south one degree with 100 point dildo	
35:46		feed from the northwest corner of	
35:48		deadlock to note that the statement	
35:52		distant there on south one degree was	
35:56		00.00 feet from the northwest corner of	
35:59		third law to is a kind of parenthetical	
36:02		statement that temper give the exact	
36:05		location of the point of beginning note	
36:09		also that we reference the point of	
36:12		beginning to only one lock corner and	
36:14		not the two it would be tempting to	
36:17		describe the point of beginning as being	
36:19		00 feet from the northwest corner of	
36:22		watt tube and 20 feet from the southwest	
36:26		corner a lot to that however would be a	
36:30		double call if a later survey shows that	
36:33		the true length of the west line of the	
36:36		lot is longer or shorter than 120 feet	
36:42		the reader is forced to decide which one	
36:45		to use or whether to prorate the	
36:47		difference double calls are ambiguous	
36:50		and should be avoided a third way of	
36:54		doing this would be to commend FG and	
36:57		establish a two point of beginning as B	
37:01		we see this method highlighted on screen	
37:04		now it might read like this commencing	
37:09		at the northwest corner of lot 1 of 10	
37:12		track 1124 thence along the west line	
37:15		instead watch south one degree west 105	
37:20		points bill bill feet then north 88	
37:23		geez 56.0 feed to the west line of Feb	
37:28		law 2 and the 2 point of beginning the	
37:31		conveyance begin the conveyance begins	
37:35		at the two point of beginning to line	
37:37		from the point of commencement to the to	
37:40		the point of beginning is simply a means	
37:42		of locating and orienting the	
37:45		description	
37:49		listen relative to a secure line that	
37:53		can be located on the ground this that	
37:57		needs establishes the basis of bearings	
37:59		on the west line a lot 1 instead of the	
38:03		west line a lot too there may actually	
38:06		be several courts between the point of	
38:08		commencement and the two point of	
38:10		beginning depending on the nature of	
38:12		partial if the decision man run	
38:15		clockwise around the farkle from the two	
38:19		point of beginning the free line called	
38:21		DC is based on the west line of 11 which	
38:26		is an advantage if the location of a lot	
38:29		lines for a lot two are in doubt that	
38:33		would not seem to be a problem in a	
38:35		subdivision like that shown in this	
38:37		joint however is easy to picture more	
38:41		complex Farkle or this principle might	
38:43		apply when looking for the best point to	
38:48		use its point of be to use for the point	
38:51		of beginning be sure to check the	
38:53		pedigree of each corner to see which one	
38:56		is strong enough to use without fear	
38:59		that if location can be proven wrong	
39:01		remember that a foul monument does not	
39:04		mean of the location of that corner is	
39:07		secure unless the monument is an	
39:10		original or if pedigree is such that it	
39:14		can be traced back to the original if	
39:18		that the corner cannot be found the	
39:21		writer should consider a type of	
39:23		decision that will permit free line	
39:25		calls to be tied to sound points outside	
39:28		the parcel the writer must establish a	
39:34		sound basis of bearings based on points	
39:37		and lines with location is secure the	
39:41		figure on the stringing prevent two	
39:43		choices for the basis of bearings the	
39:45		South line of the section has a slime	
39:48		the top line has chosen to cover the two	
39:51		monuments are	
39:52		oline are original and unlikely to be	
39:55		successfully challenged the quarter	
39:58		corner is calculated which means that	
40:02		someone may later prove our locations on	
40:05		a basis of bearings of find a bearing to	
40:10		align to the location is known so that	
40:14		that relationship may be used to orient	
40:17		the rest of the description different	
40:19		maps and deeds majors different varying	
40:23		for the same title line this is the	
40:26		place where mistakes are easily made or	
40:30		any that is easy to convince ourselves	
40:32		that once the point of beginning in this	
40:35		case the southeast corner of the section	
40:37		is described all we need to do is they	
40:41		westerly along the outline of the	
40:44		section eight hundred feet or whatever	
40:47		distance was needed and then continue	
40:49		around the bar for the directing of a	
40:52		section line after all is determined by	
40:54		the monuments and not by the bearing we	
40:56		have may have time to it the leader	
40:59		could find a point of beginning and	
41:01		clara westerly along the second line to	
41:04		00 feet but then the reader is stuck	
41:07		with no very given full effect mine the	
41:11		reader has no way of calculating the	
41:13		angle of intersection to turn off the	
41:15		second line to give direction to the	
41:17		next court the person's taking out the	
41:21		decision in the field needs those angles	
41:25		of intersection between courses and they	
41:28		are obtained by comparing of there	
41:30		of the adjoining court as they appear in	
41:33		the description beware of the second	
41:38		statement of bearing tell early a second	
41:41		patience of bearings is established as	
41:44		shown in the figure on now on the screen	
41:46		when a call is made to and then along a	
41:49		title line in the body of the decision	
41:51		and the true location of that title line	
41:54		is different from that indicated by the	
41:57		very used in the desciption in other	
42:00		words the relationship between the line	
42:03		and the very design to it is different	
42:06		from that established in the initial	
42:08		intended basis of bearings in this	
42:13		drawing the point of beginning and	
42:15		abatement of bearings are properly	
42:17		established along the one secure line	
42:20		however a call is made along the east	
42:23		line of the section which is not secure	
42:25		your bad line is not where the writers	
42:28		thought it was a new basis of bearings	
42:32		have been established a tomb for the	
42:36		moment that the corridor we've seen	
42:37		crossing this section continued on into	
42:40		the next second to the east suppose all	
42:43		bolts that the description for the	
42:45		powerful to the east uses the insecure	
42:48		section line for ovation for Barry the	
42:53		to the kitchens will fit neatly together	
42:55		only if the section line is exactly	
42:59		where the writer thought it was the	
43:02		difference between the section corner	
43:03		and the point where the North line of	
43:05		the court of crossing the spectral lines	
43:07		would be exactly the same in each	
43:11		decision if however the section line is	
43:15		really found to be in a different place	
43:17		the difference between the section from	
43:20		the second corner to the North line of	
43:22		the quarter will be	
43:24		went in the to the fiction in other word	
43:28		there will be an unintended job in the	
43:30		northerly line of the corridor this	
43:34		drawing shows the difference between the	
43:36		calculated position for the east line of	
43:38		a section and the true line as	
43:40		determined by later thurley what portion	
43:44		of the area between the calculated and	
43:46		the truline actually convey we belong a	
43:50		b2c do we go right angle to the	
43:55		calculated line from B to D or do we go	
43:59		with right angles to the true line from	
44:01		B to each so long ago I a be the T is	
44:06		the probable answers remember that if	
44:10		one bearing or one doesn't have to yield	
44:13		the batter's will no longer clothes	
44:16		mathematically yet the description will	
44:19		clearly convey to the second line	
44:22		wherever it is found to be the challenge	
44:25		is to write a decision that will convey	
44:28		to the second line and at the same time	
44:32		make sure that the pre lines are	
44:35		definitely says relative to the sound	
44:37		basis of bearings in this case of South	
44:40		line of the section there are a number	
44:44		of ways of accomplishing that goal will	
44:46		be a couple of enforcing the next course	
44:51		is along the section line which is now	
44:55		the true line and not the calculated one	
44:57		the course that followed this one	
45:00		presents a problem Ricky here that the	
45:03		angle of intersection at the point where	
45:05		the description leave the true lines	
45:07		results in the direction for the 15	
45:10		court that is different from that	
45:12		intended by the writers a different	
45:16		technique	
45:17		to enable the writer to describe the	
45:19		free lines that follow in a more secure	
45:22		fashion will prevent it with a challenge	
45:26		when a call for a free line follows they	
45:29		call along the line whose location is	
45:32		somewhat uncertain as we be here the	
45:35		best answer in this case would be a	
45:37		different type of position such as an	
45:39		exception or inclusive nutrition more	
45:44		about that later plugs are separate	
45:49		statements that are normally added after	
45:52		the body of the description their	
45:55		purpose is to qualify or augment what	
45:58		had been said that far a quad may state	
46:02		the area of the park will describe or	
46:04		may state were and basis of bearings	
46:06		have been tended to be another one that	
46:09		have used in fifth position to clarify	
46:12		with the sidelines of the fair part of	
46:14		company we'd like this the sidelines of	
46:18		subscript shall be prolonged or	
46:20		shortened to have to terminate at the	
46:22		East line of said property because may	
46:26		be needed to reserve a right such as an	
46:29		amusement for ingress and egress a	
46:32		reservation remember creates a new right	
46:35		which the grantor will retain when the p	
46:38		is conveyed to the grantee augmenting	
46:42		clauses have something to what has been	
46:44		described such as the means of access to	
46:46		the park will describe another would be	
46:50		a statement indicating what portion of	
46:52		the other line p in the adjoining street	
46:54		is intended to be conveyed you will find	
46:58		capitals of these and other clauses in	
47:00		your workbook now we'll talk about the	
47:05		different types of descriptions they're	
47:08		really different techniques that are	
47:10		available for the	
47:11		depending on the knee think of them as a	
47:14		tool bar full of tools to use on the dog	
47:19		specialized land refer to land that was	
47:22		subdivided by the federal government	
47:23		qualité within public domain the land	
47:27		was surveyed in accordance with federal	
47:29		law and plateau those surveys were	
47:32		prepared to use in identifying the land	
47:34		and to aid in conveying at the private	
47:37		parties and various government agencies	
47:40		however the platform aced on the survey	
47:43		and depended on it the location of the	
47:47		original monument constitute the final	
47:49		proof of the size shape and location of	
47:54		a given artful even though the size and	
47:56		shape may be considerably different from	
47:59		that shown on the platte decisions and	
48:03		technolog land contain the second in	
48:06		which the part was located south	
48:12		you	
48:19		some tips which tell how far north or	
48:22		south of the initial point the part	
48:24		where the range which fell off our east	
48:27		or west of the initial point the parcel	
48:30		is Meridian identified the initial point	
48:34		Hanna Marin passing through it the	
48:38		official plan including approval date	
48:40		city of any county and state there are	
48:48		three initial points in the state of	
48:50		California their locations were chosen	
48:53		arbitrarily by the original government	
48:55		for their defeat a general location on	
48:58		the stream now every section wide land	
49:02		description in the state is reference to	
49:05		one of these three points let's take a	
49:08		look closer look at one of them the	
49:12		highlighted square is called a Township	
49:15		and it is described as being Township	
49:18		three found range three West commonly	
49:22		abbreviated t3s are three W that means	
49:26		that it is located three townships south	
49:29		of the initial points and three west of	
49:31		it a description of this Township would	
49:35		read down to three stops reign three	
49:39		West San Bernardino meridians or Mount	
49:41		Diablo or humbled Meridian in the city	
49:44		of if any Kalyan state of California	
49:48		according to official plat thereof	
49:50		approved and the approval be the	
49:53		approval date of the official plan is	
49:55		important there may be a number of flats	
49:58		and it is important to be clear which	
50:02		one we're referring to there would be an	
50:05		original plaque there may be a later in	
50:08		the	
50:09		ended leave early and following that a	
50:12		dependent resurvey and that they even be	
50:15		a collective dependent refurb a decision	
50:20		rating problem in the ls exam may not	
50:23		furnish an approval based in that case	
50:26		you will have to accept what they give	
50:29		you and ignore the day each normal	
50:34		Township is broken down further in the	
50:37		following manner a normal Township	
50:40		contains thirty six sections numbers	
50:42		beginning at the northeast corner of the	
50:44		township and running westerly across the	
50:47		township then south one tier and then	
50:50		easily across the township and so forth	
50:52		until 36 is disturbed reached out the	
50:55		southeast corner if we highlight cousin	
50:59		digits we will notice an interesting	
51:01		sequence that should make it easier to	
51:03		remember which sections are on the	
51:05		perimeter of the township note the	
51:07		sequence of a number is highlighted in	
51:09		blue beginning of section 1 first	
51:13		clockwise along the east side then	
51:16		counterclockwise beginning again as	
51:18		section 1 then remembering the direction	
51:21		in which the sections are numbered as	
51:24		indicated by the yellow arrows on the	
51:26		screen it's an easy matter to number all	
51:29		of the sections section 22 is	
51:32		highlighted on the screen the decision	
51:35		of the township we have just talked	
51:37		about can be easily adapted to describe	
51:40		section 22 by simply adding the to the	
51:43		description usually in front of it here	
51:47		we have a closer look at the southwest	
51:50		quarter of section 22 broken into	
51:53		adequate parts with the northeast	
51:54		quarter of the southwest quarters	
51:56		highlighted we can easily expand our	
51:59		magician further to describe only in a	
52:02		highlighted area it would read the	
52:06		northeast quarter of the Southwest	
52:08		quarter of section 22 down two facedowns	
52:11		reign three wear them with a needle	
52:14		Ian in the city of county of state of	
52:17		California according to official plat	
52:19		thereof approved and the approval date	
52:23		remember that the easy way to read a	
52:25		description like this or the right one	
52:28		for that matter is to read or write it	
52:31		backwards that description will locate	
52:34		that particular parcel with reference to	
52:37		the San Bernardino initial point is	
52:40		unique in that it will describe only one	
52:43		parcel although a good deal of terrain	
52:46		would be necessary to market out in the	
52:48		field the excess and deficiency	
52:53		resulting from the survey of the young	
52:56		theory of the township were placed in	
52:58		the sections along the north and west	
53:00		lines of the township this was all the	
53:03		importance of those sections being other	
53:05		than the intended size and shape they	
53:09		were assigned lot numbers the	
53:11		description of one of these would read	
53:14		lottery in the northwest quarters that	
53:17		you free instead of the northeast corner	
53:21		of the Northwest quarter of Beckham tree	
53:26		perhaps a template description of all is	
53:29		the map reference description it	
53:32		describes a powerful as shown on a	
53:35		particular map calling for that map has	
53:38		the effect of incorporating that entire	
53:41		map is necessary into the description	
53:43		just as if it were printed on the face	
53:46		of the document anything on the map may	
53:49		be used to locate the park along the	
53:51		ground decisions of this kind are	
53:54		shortened you need to write this one	
53:56		would read rock one block	
54:04		the office of the county reporter of	
54:06		dead county note that is their	
54:09		description the preamble and body are	
54:12		combined in one statement one advantage	
54:16		in the description like this is that it	
54:19		is short and easy too late it also gives	
54:23		the reason the authority to use the	
54:25		entire map is necessary to locate the	
54:28		farkle one disadvantage is the fact that	
54:32		the description should not give the	
54:34		reader a picture of the size and shape	
54:36		of the parcel the reader must have the	
54:41		map to see that another disadvantage is	
54:45		the fact that if the lot number or the	
54:47		block designation were incorrect the	
54:50		result would be disastrous now we're	
54:55		about reached the halfway point in our	
54:57		presentation for take a short break
