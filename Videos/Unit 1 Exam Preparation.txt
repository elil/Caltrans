00:00		you	
00:40		you	
00:49		welcome to Caltrans lsit Els exam	
00:52		preparation course one aid in your	
00:56		preparation for California licensure	
00:58		examinations or dove caution don't use	
01:02		this course as your only preparation	
01:04		devise and follow a regular schedule of	
01:07		study which begins months before the	
01:10		test worked many problems in each area	
01:13		not just those in this courses workbook	
01:16		but problems from other sources as well	
01:20		this course is funded by Caltrans but	
01:23		you and I owe a profound thanks to	
01:26		others the courses instructors from the	
01:29		academic community the private sector	
01:31		other public agencies and from Caltrans	
01:35		as well we wish you well in your study	
01:38		toward becoming a member of California's	
01:40		professional land surveying community	
01:47		how do you do my name is Chuck Safford	
01:51		I'm a licensed land surveyor in the	
01:53		state of California I work for Rick	
01:56		engineering in San Diego as a principal	
01:59		survey analyst this first unit of the	
02:03		video workshop has two main objectives	
02:07		one to assist you in the preparation to	
02:10		take the lsit and the ls exam and two to	
02:16		help you prepare for the balance of the	
02:18		specific subject matters that will	
02:21		follow in the balance of the video	
02:25		presentations for the majority of you	
02:29		this will be the most important test	
02:31		that you perhaps will ever take in	
02:34		addition to personal satisfaction of	
02:37		passing an examination state licensure	
02:41		licensure usually leads to financial	
02:44		gain and possible job promotion and	
02:47		advancement many of you will be taking a	
02:51		test for the first time since high	
02:54		school others of you will have had the	
02:57		advantage of college courses and perhaps	
03:00		college graduate	
03:03		some people test very well and I have	
03:07		seen other people that completely fall	
03:09		apart as soon as the word test is	
03:13		mentioned the plus factor in taking an	
03:18		examination is self-confidence and the	
03:23		way to gain that self-confidence is	
03:25		through knowing your subject and this is	
03:28		why we're here to help you gain the	
03:31		proficiency the knowledge and the self	
03:34		confidence to take the examination I've	
03:39		spent over 20 years in part-time	
03:42		teaching and community colleges in adult	
03:45		education that included 13 years	
03:48		teaching in the Southern California	
03:49		surveyors apprenticeship program	
03:52		I have also set up special courses such	
03:55		as this for students and taking the	
03:58		examination and I have also graded	
04:02		portions of the ls exam for the state of	
04:06		California and in this grading I've	
04:09		noticed that many applicants really	
04:13		weren't prepared they didn't know the	
04:16		subject matter they didn't have the	
04:18		experience and they shouldn't have been	
04:20		there in the first place	
04:22		as an example I've seen a twenty plus	
04:26		point problem in a legal description	
04:29		that was left completely blank by	
04:32		applicants there is really no excuse for	
04:35		this if you plan to become a licensed	
04:37		land surveyor you must know the subject	
04:40		matter do not take the examination	
04:43		without being fully prepared in this	
04:47		video session we will emphasize	
04:50		preparation and organization on how to	
04:54		take this particular examination how to	
04:57		study we'll also review some problems	
05:00		remember that the test and problem	
05:03		format for the California State	
05:06		examination has remained the same for	
05:09		about the past dozen years but the	
05:12		format may change we don't know	
05:15		in fact there's a rumor that the board	
05:18		may in within a few years switch over to	
05:22		the NCA II type format where the	
05:27		majority of the test may be multiple	
05:31		choice and maybe just two or three hours	
05:35		pertaining to state law whether or not	
05:38		this happens we don't know I personally	
05:41		hope that it does not we will not be	
05:47		answering any specific problem examples	
05:50		in this session that will be done in the	
05:53		subsequent video presentations primarily	
05:57		I'll be addressing the LS examination	
06:00		but much of what is said about the LS	
06:03		also pertains to the lsit test as well	
06:09		specifically the areas that we will	
06:12		cover the application to take the	
06:15		examination learning how to study taking	
06:21		the examination and we'll review of the	
06:24		0990 and 1991 test problems and the	
06:29		appeal process for the lsit test the	
06:36		only formal requirements that they state	
06:38		is that they may require two years	
06:42		experience for information and sample	
06:47		test of the lsit you write the National	
06:51		Council of engineering examiners which	
06:54		is the NCE their address is P o box one

07:06		usually the lsit examination in	
07:10		California is given twice a year once in	
07:13		April and once in October the filing	
07:17		deadline for the April examination is	
07:20		usually early January and for the	
07:23		October examination is	
07:26		August the LS examination is only given	
07:30		once a year	
07:31		generally in April for 1993 the date is	
07:36		April 17th with the filing deadline of	
07:40		December 11th 1992 for the LS	
07:46		examination application you write to the

08:36		you have to have full time experience of	
08:39		six years at the time of application	
08:43		this includes one year of responsible	
08:46		field training and one year of	
08:51		responsible office work if you have a	
08:56		Bachelor of Science degree from an	
08:59		accredited four-year university such as	
09:01		Fresno State Ohio State University of	
09:04		Maine that gives you four years	
09:08		qualified experience also passing the	
09:12		lsit gives you two years experience if	
09:17		you've received an Associate of Arts	
09:19		degree in a two-year program at a	
09:21		community college that will give you one	
09:24		year experience you must have employment	
09:29		verification from the employer verifying	
09:33		at least four years experience of work	
09:37		you must have	
09:39		or or more references from licensed land	
09:44		surveyors they do not necessarily have	
09:46		to be from the state of California or	
09:49		from registered civil engineers provided	
09:53		in California they were licensed prior	
09:56		to January 1 1982 or they have passed	
10:02		the ls exam themselves these references	
10:06		must be sent along with your application	
10:11		any college transcripts must be	
10:15		certified by the school and sent by the	
10:19		school to the board the fees for the	
10:23		application unfortunately have risen	
10:25		over the years the 1991 application fee	
10:29		for California was 175 dollars it is	
10:35		non-refundable	
10:36		if you do not pass the exam they will	
10:40		refund half your money if you do not	
10:43		pass the application process contact the	
10:48		board for applications schedules and	
10:51		requirements ask for quote information	
10:56		for licensing as a land surveyor unquote	
10:59		and the quote plain language pamphlet of	
11:04		the Land Surveyors Act and the board	
11:06		rules unquote while you're asking for	
11:11		these you better also get a copy of the	
11:14		state of California subdivision map act	
11:16		for the year that you're going to take	
11:18		the exam both the subdivision map act	
11:23		and the land surveyors act are	
11:26		absolutely necessary to have with you	
11:28		while you are taking the examination for	
11:32		references of statutes and codes study	
11:38		habits	
11:40		it's a paramount importance that you set	
11:45		yourself a study schedule and you have	
11:49		to get the cooperation of your family in	
11:52		order to do this	
11:53		explain to them how important it is I	
11:57		would suggest that you start with a two	
12:00		hour per night 3 night per week at least	
12:06		1 months before you start the	
12:08		examination this will give you roughly	
12:12		100 hours of study and this is a minimum	
12:16		absolute memo if you're really serious	
12:20		about doing this I would double that	
12:23		scheduled study by subject matter read	
12:28		through the text and references to find	
12:31		out your strengths and your weaknesses	
12:34		take notes for further reference use a	
12:39		highlighter in your textbooks for the	
12:42		important phrases formulas and so forth	
12:45		make notes of formulas and also take	
12:49		notes of unclear subject matter that you	
12:53		want to go back to you will now have a	
12:56		rough idea for the feel of your	
12:58		strengths and weaknesses in these	
12:59		subjects I'll go back and repeat the	
13:02		process but this time start working some	
13:05		problems along with it we cannot	
13:08		overemphasize and you'll probably hear	
13:10		me say this again solve problems solve	
13:13		problems solve problems when you're	
13:20		confident with your progress it's a good	
13:23		idea to get together with another person	
13:25		who is preparing for the exam or one who	
13:29		has recently passed it and is willing to	
13:31		tutor you a little bit and spend a few	
13:33		nights swapping questions back and forth	
13:36		solving problems together and finding	
13:40		out really how much you do know by	
13:43		having the other person has two	
13:45		questions it's an excellent idea and	
13:49		help if you can get past copies of the	
13:53		LSI T and the LS exams and work the	
13:58		problems directly out of those	
14:00		examinations when you first start this	
14:03		make sure that you're working towards a	
14:06		solution	
14:07		and not spending too much attention to	
14:10		the time element of solving the problems	
14:15		if possible try to take a short seminar	
14:18		or a specialized course in the subjects	
14:23		that you feel give you the most trouble	
14:26		let's say geodetic control or	
14:29		photogrammetry such courses and seminars	
14:32		are given by the community colleges all	
14:35		over the state institutions and	
14:39		organizations such as the California	
14:41		land surveyors Association you can	
14:43		contact the local chapter of your CL si	
14:47		or your local community college for the	
14:50		time and place of these seminars always	
14:55		study in a quiet atmosphere absolutely	
14:59		no TV and no radio on people say oh I	
15:02		love to study with the radio on but you	
15:05		really don't absorb as much as you	
15:08		should with any distraction at all do	
15:12		constant review and problem solving with	
15:15		attention to quick solutions and problem	
15:18		solving as you approach the examination	
15:21		date don't study the night before the	
15:25		exam relax don't party just relax get a	
15:29		good night's sleep taking the	
15:32		examination know the exact location of	
15:37		the building where the examination is	
15:40		taking place know how long it takes you	
15:42		to get from the your home to the exam	
15:47		site allow for minor emergencies it's my	
15:51		feeling that I prefer to drive alone to	
15:55		the exam I don't like the wait for	
15:57		another person to pick me up I want to	
15:59		be responsible for myself have all your	
16:03		textbooks and your references materials	
16:06		with you carry these in a large crate or	
16:10		box and it will be a boxful you'll be	
16:14		surprised so you can carry them all at	
16:17		once and you'll have them	
16:20		the desk at the exam for easy handling	
16:23		and reference it's a board rule that all	
16:27		reference materials must be in textbook	
16:31		form pamphlet form or a loose-leaf	
16:34		notebook	
16:35		no loose papers are allowed in the	
16:39		examination room at all have all of your	
16:44		textbooks and binders index tab for	
16:47		quick reference no generally for every	
16:50		subject matter is in the text you cannot	
16:52		afford to spend any time leafing through	
16:56		a book during the examination trying to	
16:59		find a subject matter items to have with	
17:03		you when you enter the examination room	
17:07		have personal identification and the ID	
17:12		identification number as applied to you	
17:14		by the board with your application your	
17:18		books your references your pamphlets	
17:21		your notebooks don't overload on	
17:24		everything I think it's rather	
17:26		ridiculous to take three standard books	
17:28		on surveying one will suffice have a	
17:34		clock or a timepiece with you so you can	
17:36		keep track of your time a calculator	
17:40		with fresh batteries fresh batteries and	
17:43		an extra battery pack that's also fresh	
17:47		you don't want to run out there are no	
17:49		electric plug-in calculators allowed in	
17:52		the room no tape discs or program cards	
17:57		or either oral pardon me are allowed in	
18:01		your calculators also they can be	
18:04		pre-programmed but you cannot insert	
18:09		program cards during the examination	
18:12		take several pencils and a ballpoint pen	
18:15		take at least three different colored	
18:17		pencils they're handy for retracing	
18:20		different deed alignments and calls	
18:22		lines of sights control nets and so	
18:25		forth an engineer's scale six inches	
18:31		will be suffice a protractor	
18:34		a small straightedge or triangle and a	
18:37		pencil compass for drawing curves is	
18:39		also handy there will be Proctor's in	
18:43		the room to answer any questions that	
18:46		are allowable to hand out the test	
18:49		booklets and to explain the examination	
18:53		period the first session of the LS exam	
18:58		lasts for hours in the morning then	
19:00		there is a lunch break of an out eat a	
19:03		light lunch high-energy don't pig out on	
19:06		anything you just get sleepy and	
19:08		sluggish from there and the afternoon	
19:11		there is another four-hour session there	
19:15		is no noticeable difference generally	
19:17		between the two sessions you get the	
19:19		same types of problems usually in each	
19:21		exam the LS exam is an open book all the	
19:28		way through each problem is given so	
19:32		many points the runs with the greatest	
19:34		point count are generally the more	
19:36		difficult and take the most amount of	
19:40		time work as much of each problem as you	
19:45		can even though you may not know the	
19:48		final answer you will be given points	
19:51		for what portions that you do answer	
19:54		correctly before you start the exam	
19:58		quickly count up the total points for	
20:03		that session let's say the morning	
20:05		session is a hundred and eighty points	
20:07		you have four hours which is 240 minutes	
20:11		that gives you about one and a half	
20:14		minutes per point thus a 24-point	
20:20		problem should take you roughly 36	
20:23		minutes to work now work within this	
20:26		time frame you wouldn't want to attack a	
20:28		24-point problem and spend 55 minutes on	
20:31		it you have to keep track of your time	
20:33		all the way through on the back of each	
20:39		test booklet there is usually a	
20:40		compliation of the subject matter of	
20:43		each problem and the number of points	
20:46		assigned	
20:47		to that problem if there is a subject	
20:50		matter that you know that you can cool	
20:53		it real quick attack that problem first	
20:56		this will get you warmed up for the exam	
21:00		give you a little bit of self confidence	
21:02		and it'll also give you more time to	
21:05		work the more difficult problems read	
21:09		the problems thoroughly this is most	
21:13		important pick out key phrases and	
21:16		instructions such as solve to the	
21:20		nearest second give a reference make no	
21:23		assumptions calculations not needed I've	
21:29		seen many people lose points on any type	
21:32		of test when they don't read the problem	
21:34		thoroughly also pay strict attention to	
21:37		units of measurement are they dealing	
21:40		with chains feet or meters remember the	
21:45		principles of land surveying if you're	
21:48		dealing with a sectionalized land	
21:50		problem know where you are within that	
21:53		township where you want a range line are	
21:56		you on a corner common the four interior	
21:58		sections makes a lot of difference in	
22:00		how you're going to prorate be neat	
22:04		there is nothing more frustrating to a	
22:07		greater than trying to route through a	
22:11		solution to a problem and have scratches	
22:14		and chicken marks and erasers and	
22:17		sometimes they just give up and say no	
22:20		credit show all the formulas that you	
22:23		use write down those formulas and then	
22:26		fill them in with the numerical values	
22:28		as you make each solution step remember	
22:31		the grater cannot see the answers in	
22:33		your calculator and if you happen to	
22:36		multiply two by two and come up with six	
22:39		and you have everything else right and	
22:41		the formula is correct you'll be given	
22:42		probably some point count for it if you	
22:45		can see your direct error if the problem	
22:49		is an SI type be concise give references	
22:54		but make no direct quotes from a	
22:57		textbook the graders know you can read	
23:01		but they want your own words in an	
23:04		answer don't get bogged down by a	
23:07		problem if you feel yourself up against	
23:12		a stone wall leave that problem go on to	
23:15		the next one and if you finish come back	
23:17		and try to redo the problem that was	
23:22		given you trouble the overview of the LS	
23:31		examinations and practically all cases	
23:36		in the state of California in order to	
23:39		qualify for the LS exam you first must	
23:42		pass the lsit	
23:48		please note that the lsit	
23:51		no longer has an open book section but	
23:54		is now an eight-hour closed book exam	
24:02		there are a lot of multiple-choice	
24:04		problems and some solutions fundamentals	
24:10		of land surveying but no specific	
24:13		questions on California state law	
24:15		statues or principles will be asked on	
24:18		the lsit	
24:23		pardoning the LS exam is broadly based	
24:28		upon legal principles and professional	
24:32		practice within the state of California	
24:37		knowledge of the statutes and codes are	
24:40		required however there's a lot of	
24:44		problem-solving in each exam since 1984	
24:49		the California LS exam has covered the	
24:53		following subjects these subjects are	
24:55		not necessarily in every exam but this	
24:59		is the general scope public land surveys	
25:02		and boundary determination astronomy	
25:06		writing legal descriptions riparian	
25:09		rights	
25:11		geodetic surveys and control the LS act	
25:16		and the subdivision map act grading	
25:19		plans construction surveys vertical	
25:23		curves of vertical and horizontal	
25:25		alignment the California coordinate	
25:29		system latitude and longitude	
25:32		photogrammetry and topographic surveys	
25:36		they even had a problem a few years back	
25:39		and where you had to draw a simple	
25:43		record of survey and show all the	
25:45		certificates that had to appear on that	
25:47		record over fifty percent of the	
25:51		problems have been in public lands and	
25:53		boundary determination the rest in order	
25:57		have been California law state plane	
26:01		system and photogrammetry through 1991	
26:07		to my knowledge there have been no	
26:10		questions on GPS the global positioning	
26:13		system nor any technical problems on	
26:16		nad83	
26:18		but I do expect these to come up in the	
26:21		exam and then at very near future the	
26:25		2991 exam had a very difficult problem	
26:28		on error analysis it was the first one	
26:31		that I know of that's appeared at any	
26:33		test very few people even attempted to	
26:38		try it a general review of the 1990 exam	
26:45		there were two hundred and ninety five	
26:48		total points you had to have a passing	
26:51		grade of fifty seven percent and about	
26:55		thirty one percent of those that took	
26:57		the exam passed it very briefly the	
27:00		problem samples were sectionalized land	
27:04		and a Rancho a boundary	
27:07		they gave 12 points for the method and	
27:10		26 points for the solution a restoration	
27:14		of a lost quarter corner you had to	
27:16		state the principle used to restore the	
27:19		corner a deed conveyance problem	
27:23		a boundary determination and write a	
27:26		legal description for 40 points a	
27:29		boundary determination from a deed a	
27:32		boundary determination of a lot in an	
27:35		old subdivision you had to write a legal	
27:38		description of your boundary and state	
27:40		whether a record a survey was necessary	
27:43		26	
27:44		pardon me 16 points for the method and	
27:46		20 points for the calculation a boundary	
27:51		adjustment problem and a legal	
27:53		description with it and lists the	
27:55		statutes and the code involved in a	
27:58		boundary adjustment there was a word	
28:01		completion regarding nad83	
28:05		but it was worth only 10 points a	
28:08		photogrammetry problem which I'll cover	
28:11		in the 91 exam very similar and a	
28:14		grading problem involved in lot pads	
28:18		Street and curb grades there was a 16	
28:23		point problem in which you had to give 8	
28:25		possible sources of research data for a	
28:29		boundary analysis problem there was a	
28:33		very heavy emphasis in ninety on legal	
28:36		descriptions and boundary determination	
28:41		now we'll go into a more detailed	
28:43		analysis of the 1991 exam there were 300	
28:50		total points last April a passing mark	
28:55		was a hundred and seventy-five points	
28:58		which is about 58 percent a little over	
29:02		250 people in the state took the	
29:05		examination and 74 people passed it	
29:08		that's about 14 percent it was a very	
29:12		very difficult test this is a sample of	
29:18		the booklet that you receive this is	
29:22		section a the morning section and you	
29:25		can see very briefly the sketch for one	
29:30		of the problems that they give you these	
29:33		statements	
29:34		and the requirements that they show you	
29:38		do not work any of your problems in this	
29:41		booklet they will give you answer sheets	
29:45		to do all of your solutions and to show	
29:48		your answer and to show your	
29:52		identification number you do not write	
29:55		your name on either this test book or	
29:59		your answer sheet everything is done by	
30:02		an identification number that is sent to	
30:05		you upon approval of your application	
30:08		the morning session of the 1991 exam was	
30:12		a hundred and fifty three points now	
30:15		each problem will give you the point	
30:19		count and also a subdivision of partial	
30:25		answers within each problem however most	
30:29		of the problems are graded on elements	
30:32		in other words there may be a 40-point	
30:35		problem broken down into three parts of	
30:39		fifteen fifteen and ten but a 15-point	
30:43		problem you may pick up 1 2 3 4 points	
30:47		for partial answers within that problem	
30:51		a 1 was a 30-point problem graded	
30:55		elements from 1 to 4 points each you had	
30:58		to write a legal description of a	
31:00		pipeline easement that covered two	
31:02		parcels of land	
31:04		you were given a sketch of the reference	
31:07		maps some bearings and all the distances	
31:13		the basic necessities true point a	
31:16		beginning	
31:17		the point of beginning basis of bearings	
31:20		tides daddy'd lines shortening or	
31:23		lengthening the sidelines of the	
31:25		easements at the project boundary calls	
31:29		to record maps and you had to count some	
31:34		of the bearings problem a2 was 36 points	
31:40		you were given a sketch of a block and a	
31:46		new subdivision	
31:47		the northerly portion of that block you	
31:49		were also given all of the measured and	
31:51		record distances around the block and	
31:54		they measured angles you had to state	
31:57		the principle of subdividing a lot out	
32:01		of the new subdivision within the old	
32:03		block and this was this real stickler on	
32:06		that problem was the principle of it you	
32:09		had to show all your calculations	
32:10		compare your measured distances with	
32:14		record distances and state the principle	
32:18		and also state the statute on whether or	
32:23		not the record a survey had to be filed	
32:25		along with your survey problem a3 was 30	
32:30		points the elements were 1 2 5 points	
32:33		each it was a photogrametry problem and	
32:35		this is fairly typical of the type of	
32:37		photogrammetry problem that they give it	
32:43		was horizontal and vertical control over	
32:46		two sections of public land you were	
32:48		given the focal length the photo size	
32:52		the C factor the model size the map	
32:57		ratio and the height of average terrain	
33:01		above sea level you are required to	
33:04		state the flying height above sea level	
33:07		the minimum number of flight lines the	
33:11		minimum number of models minimum number	
33:14		of photos minimum number of horizontal	
33:17		and vertical control points the negative	
33:20		scale nominal map size target or premark	
33:25		size and the accuracy requirements of	
33:28		control pardon me of contour and spot	
33:32		elevations now the average student of	
33:37		land surveying really is not familiar	
33:41		with the problem of this type so this is	
33:44		one of the subject matter that you have	
33:46		to pay attention to in your videos and	
33:48		also do extra study on	
33:52		problem a4 was 21 points this was the	
33:56		tough who was a standard error ellipse	
33:59		you were given a measurement of an angle	
34:03		and a distance to a point you were	
34:06		required to compute and sketch the	
34:08		standard error ellipse and dimension the	
34:11		major and the minor axis and the theta	
34:15		angle determine the probability of your	
34:18		point falling within the ellipse	
34:20		determine a 95% probability ellipse the	
34:25		shape of the ellipse for six different	
34:27		combinations of angle and measurement	
34:31		instruments it was a real dilly I'll	
34:34		tell you that problem a5 was 36 points	
34:39		the elements were two to ten points	
34:40		legal principles and calcs of a	
34:43		fractional section and joining a Rancho	
34:45		you were given various coordinates on	
34:49		certain section corners and adjoining	
34:51		section corners record distances along	
34:54		the section and Rancho lines and found	
34:57		original corners you are required by	
35:00		proportional method to re-establish	
35:02		certain lost corners on the Rancho	
35:04		boundary and the section and calculate	
35:07		these coordinates you were to show all	
35:10		your work and site the government	
35:13		references for single or double	
35:15		proportion the afternoon portion of the	
35:21		31 exam was a hundred and forty seven	
35:23		points I will go over just a couple of	
35:25		problems within that another legal	
35:29		description of a 40-foot wide easement	
35:34		there were certain distances bearings	
35:37		and curve elements you were to write the	
35:39		legal make no assumption calculate the	
35:43		curves and various bearings a problem on	
35:48		water boundaries 27 points to determine	
35:52		the boundary of a parcel land along the	
35:54		Pacific Ocean	
35:55		you were given tide station data to	
35:59		stations with various vertical datums	
36:01		and a sketch with elevations and	
36:05		distances you were then required to show	
36:07		a broken back boundary along the Pacific	
36:10		Ocean they also required which state	
36:16		agency has the authority in boundary	
36:20		determination along the Pacific Ocean	
36:22		and which state agency has the authority	
36:26		on the development of this property then	
36:30		they also ask you where would the	
36:33		property line be with regards to datum	
36:36		if the same parcel abutted a natural	
36:40		inland lake instead of the Pacific Ocean	
36:44		they had a problem on astronomy which	
36:48		was a solar shooting nothing was given	
36:51		they asked you for two methods of	
36:53		determining azmuth which is more	
36:56		accurate what is your vertical angle	
37:00		usage	
37:02		how will parallax and refraction fit	
37:05		into it what are your likely errors what	
37:08		are your sources of accurate time and	
37:10		what are your best times of observation	
37:22		problem b6 skipping a couple was a ten	
37:26		points you got one point each for the	
37:29		answers required to cite the government	
37:32		code and the section numbers one may a	
37:37		licensed surveyor practice civil	
37:39		engineering how do you rectify errors on	
37:43		a record a survey what are the rules for	
37:46		right of entry onto private property how	
37:51		do you treat monuments on a road	
37:53		construction project who has to sign	
37:57		seal Maps plots and legal descriptions	
38:02		who is authorized to practice	
38:05		photogrammetry what are the rules for	
38:09		the recored ation of a record of survey	
38:11		and the certificates along with it when	
38:15		as a city engineer authorized to	
38:18		practice land surveying what are the	
38:20		rules and statutes of a boundary line	
38:22		adjustment and what are the sections of	
38:26		the California state plane system and	
38:32		that finishes the examination I'll now	
38:37		give you what I feel are some basic	
38:39		references and text that you should take	
38:42		in these will be also stated in your	
38:45		study guides that will be handed out and	
38:48		also each of your subsequent instructors	
38:51		will have their favorite references to	
38:55		use there is a very good book called the	
39:00		land surveyor a license examination	
39:01		review manual by CV Chalapathi he's with	
39:06		the Long Beach State University it's	
39:10		published under the professional	
39:11		engineering development publications of	
39:13		Long Beach California	
39:15		he also along with others in Southern	
39:18		California offer a very good seminar	
39:22		every year for the ls preparation 4567	
39:28		review questions for land surveyors by	
39:31		rust drinker is a good book for	
39:34		preparation	
39:35		Andrew Harbin wrote another book on land	
39:39		surveyor reference manual Roy Minich of	
39:42		landmark enterprises as a land surveying	
39:46		test training manual and I myself put	
39:50		out a small syllabus on taking this	
39:52		examination it's published through	
39:54		landmark enterprises also remember these	
39:59		are to be used in conjunction with these	
40:01		video the video presentations will be	
40:06		very very helpful for you in problem	
40:09		solutions and in references and remember	
40:13		to take the study guide that accompanies	
40:15		the videos along with you as a reference	
40:18		when you go in to take the examination	
40:21		now I've been talking about all of the	
40:25		study habits this is in addition to	
40:28		reviewing these videos to remember in	
40:32		conjunction with your study format to	
40:35		also set aside time to make use of and	
40:39		study with the video presentations the	
40:45		final thing that we'll go into is the	
40:48		appeal process if and we hope it's a big	
40:52		if you do not pass the examination you	
40:57		will be given sixty days in which to	
41:00		file an appeal with the board when you	
41:04		receive notice of failure and you're	
41:09		within say ten points of the passing	
41:12		grade and they'll let you know if you	
41:14		pass the exam they don't tell you what	
41:17		your score was if you fail the exam	
41:19		they'll tell you so let's say you had	
41:22		one hundred and sixty seven points out	
41:24		of the possible 175 this year 91 then it	
41:29		would behoove you to apply for an appeal	
41:34		to try to pick up those extra five or	
41:36		six points	
41:39		you have to write the board and request	
41:41		the appeal they'll let you know within	
41:44		45 days whether your appeal has been	
41:46		granted around if it's granted then you	
41:50		send them a fee of $10 and they will	
41:53		send you the official appeal form and a	
41:59		copy of your test booklets along with	
42:03		the copy of your solution sheets now you	
42:06		have to be very diligent and methodical	
42:10		and thorough and going through your	
42:13		answer sheets to find out if you can	
42:17		possibly pick up some more points you	
42:19		may feel that yes I answered this and by	
42:23		the process of elimination they didn't	
42:26		give me any credit for it you will also	
42:29		have to show evidence of why you think	
42:33		you should be given more points and you	
42:37		have to give references along with your	
42:41		appeal form so it's a very very	
42:44		methodical process that you have to go	
42:46		through these will be regraded by a	
42:51		greater and only those problems that you	
42:56		request to be reviewed will be regraded	
43:00		so you have to point out the problems if	
43:04		you want to go through all of them you	
43:05		can do it but generally that's not worth	
43:07		it you just want to pick up some certain	
43:09		points and maybe it was one particular	
43:11		problem that gave you some nasty spells	
43:16		on but you feel that you did have	
43:18		necessary points at the same time you	
43:24		returned the completed appeal form make	
43:29		sure that you request to be scheduled	
43:32		for the next exam because you probably	
43:36		will not hear whether they passed your	
43:39		appeal or not until after the	
43:41		application deadline for the next exam	
43:44		the exam 91 was given in April they	
43:48		graded it in mid-may the people found	
43:51		out the Rizzo	
43:53		in early September you have a 60 day	
43:58		time and it usually takes about a 60 day	
44:00		time to make an appeal so that takes you	
44:03		up into November and it still isn't	
44:06		graded so by the time they get around to	
44:08		regrading it that is towards the end of	
44:11		December or early January and you've	
44:14		passed the application time for the next	
44:17		exam and you're going to have to wait a	
44:18		full more year to take it now this	
44:26		completes this particular video session	
44:29		we hope that it will assist you in	
44:31		taking the exam and preparing you for	
44:34		the subsequent video sessions the only	
44:39		thing I can say to you now is that old	
44:41		Boy Scout motto be prepared thank you	
45:13		you
