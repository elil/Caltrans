This one is split into two parts so consider adding 54:57 or somewhere there about to correct numbers.  If you let me know the proper correction value, I'll fix these here.

00:10		Wow welcome back let's continue our	
00:13		overview of the various types of	
00:14		descriptions and how they are used here	
00:18		we have a meets and bounds description	
00:19		which gives all of the dimensions and	
00:22		angular relationships of the sides it	
00:25		might read like this that portion of lot	
00:28		to Block B tract 1124 in the city of	
00:32		County of state of California	
00:34		according to map recorded in book 100	
00:37		pages 16 and 17 of maps in the office of	
00:41		the County Recorder of said County	
00:42		described as follows beginning at the	
00:46		southwest corner have said lot to thence	
00:49		along the west line have said lot to a	
00:51		bearing and a distance thence a bearing	
00:54		in the distance to the east line of said	
00:57		lot to thence the long said east line of	
01:00		bearing and a distance to the southeast	
01:02		corner of said lot to thence along the	
01:06		south line of said law to a bearing on a	
01:09		distance to the point of beginning note	
01:13		that the point of beginning is a record	
01:15		point that both the surveyor and the	
01:17		title person should be able to find the	
01:20		basis of bearings is established along	
01:23		the west line of the lot remember that	
01:26		anything on that map may be used to	
01:29		locate that line the free line called	
01:32		the one that crosses the lot is located	
01:36		by turning the deflection angle derived	
01:39		from comparing the bearings of the first	
01:41		two courses note again that if the	
01:45		description had given only a general	
01:47		direction along the west line of the lot	
01:49		like northerly along the west line of	
01:52		said lot and then a bearing for the free	
01:55		line called the reader would not be able	
01:58		to get that deflection angle the	
02:02		distance in the free line call would	
02:04		have to yield if necessary in order to	
02:06		reach the east line as stated in the	
02:08		description here again the call was	
02:11		simply to the lot line and not to a	
02:14		specific point such as a lot corner or a	
02:18		point on the line a certain distance	
02:21		from one of the corners	
02:24		the last two courses follow along the	
02:26		title lines were whether the bearings	
02:29		and distances given fit or not a strip	
02:34		description describes Grand Tours	
02:36		property and then describes a strip of	
02:39		land that will cross the property the	
02:41		description says that any portion of the	
02:44		of the strip that falls on the Grand	
02:47		Tours property will be conveyed to the	
02:49		Grand team if the grant is an easement	
02:52		that is what is conveyed the strip is	
02:56		usually based on points and lines	
02:58		outside the subject property it is not	
03:01		necessarily it is not necessary to know	
03:04		exactly where the Grand Tours property	
03:06		lines are a description of the strip on	
03:09		lot three as highlighted on the screen	
03:12		might read like this that portion of lot	
03:16		three block B tract 1124 in the city of	
03:20		County of state of California according	
03:23		to map recorded in book 100 pages 16 and	
03:26		7 of maps in the office of the County	
03:29		Recorder of said County included within	
03:32		a strip of land 20.00 feet wide line	
03:39		0.00 feet on each side of the following	
03:42		described line beginning at a point on	
03:46		the west line of said tract 1124 distant	
03:49		along said West line and bearing in a	
03:52		distance from the southwest corner of	
03:55		said tract thence a bearing and a	
03:58		distance to a point on the east line of	
04:00		subtract 1124 distant along said east	
04:04		line bearing on a distance from the	
04:06		southeast corner of said tract note that	
04:10		we said each side of the line and not	
04:12		either remember that the word either	
04:15		means one or the other which is	
04:17		certainly not our intent is not	
04:21		necessary to add a clause stating that	
04:24		the side line should be prolonged or	
04:26		shortened so as to terminate at the lot	
04:28		lines because that portion of the entire	
04:31		strip that falls within the lot will	
04:33		convey	
04:36		now the of descriptions the word of is	
04:40		used because it is a vital ingredient in	
04:43		all the descriptions of this type this	
04:46		type of description is designed to	
04:49		create a strip of land of fixed width	
04:52		along one border of a parcel for	
04:55		instance the southerly 10 feet of lot 2	
04:59		is understood to create a strip of land	
05:02		0 feet wide measured at right-angles	
05:05		bounded on the south by the south line	
05:08		of the lot the 10 feet might be measured	
05:12		along one of the lot lines instead of at	
05:14		right angles in which case the	
05:17		description should so state of	
05:20		description sometimes use area instead	
05:23		of distance as controlled for instance a	
05:26		description reading the South 2.00 acres	
05:31		of applied to a 4-sided parcel with each	
05:35		of the sides being close to a cardinal	
05:37		direction would be understood to set the	
05:40		North line of the two acres parallel	
05:43		with the South line of the parcel when	
05:47		the shape of the parcel is irregular	
05:49		however this type is hard to interpret	
05:53		another form of description is the	
05:57		proportional type such as the south half	
06:00		of law to the word half again means area	
06:05		and again the North line of the South	
06:08		half would be set parallel with the	
06:10		south line of the lot in cases where the	
06:12		lot lines are close to a cardinal	
06:14		direction if they are not in nearly	
06:17		cardinal directions or if the parcel is	
06:19		irregular in shape a description like	
06:22		this may be subject to more than one	
06:24		interpretation a line description is one	
06:30		that takes all of a granters property	
06:32		wherever it is lying a certain direction	
06:35		from a described line which normally	
06:38		originates and ends outside the grantors	
06:42		property the advantage is that the free	
06:45		line calls can be located with precision	
06:48		even though the grain	
06:50		torez property liens may not the one we	
06:53		see highlighted might be described like	
06:56		this that portion of lot three line	
07:00		northerly of the following described	
07:03		line then would follow a description of	
07:05		the line beginning on the track boundary	
07:07		on the west and ending on the track	
07:09		boundary on the east similar to the way	
07:12		we did in the strip description this	
07:17		description would take any portion of a	
07:19		lot three that fell northerly of that	
07:21		line whether the lot lines could be	
07:23		located or not this same described line	
07:27		can be used for each parcel at the line	
07:29		crosses only the lot number or other	
07:32		parcel identification would have to	
07:34		change the same is true for strip	
07:38		descriptions the exception method	
07:43		describes more property than is intended	
07:46		and then the unneeded portion is	
07:49		accepted which in effect subtracts it	
07:52		from the description it has the	
07:55		advantage of making it possible to	
07:57		create new property lines in a secure	
08:00		fashion this method works very well in	
08:04		the drawing now on the screen where the	
08:06		South line of the section is secured but	
08:08		the East line is not the body of the	
08:12		description can describe the highlighted	
08:14		portion including the small remainder in	
08:16		the southeast corner of a section then	
08:20		that small remainder can be accepted out	
08:23		the net result is what we now see on the	
08:27		screen this technique makes it possible	
08:30		for each of the two sets of free line	
08:33		calls to be described individually each	
08:36		one clearly based on the South line of	
08:39		the section neither is compromised in	
08:42		any way by the necessary call along the	
08:45		uncertain East line of the section now	
08:49		the inclusive type of description this	
08:53		technique is also used to create survey	
08:56		about free line calls where the location	
08:59		of one or more	
09:00		lines is uncertain the preamble says in	
09:04		effect that portion of the owners	
09:07		property such as the southeast quarter	
09:10		of section 11 included within the	
09:14		following described parcel then the new	
09:17		parcel is described deliberately	
09:19		extending it safely beyond the title	
09:22		line whose location is uncertain this	
09:25		technique can be used even if all of the	
09:28		the grantors property lines are	
09:30		uncertain as to location the new parcel	
09:34		is deliberately designed to extend	
09:36		beyond or overlap all of the grand	
09:39		towards property lines that are	
09:41		affecting the new parcel itself of	
09:44		course is based on a line that is	
09:46		secured the way to convey to the title	
09:50		line wherever it may be but at the same	
09:54		time the effect is to convey to the	
09:56		title line wherever it may be but at the	
09:59		same time it creates new property lines	
10:02		the free line calls that are surveil and	
10:05		not compromised in any way by the	
10:07		location of the uncertain title line	
10:11		this type of description is really a	
10:14		last resort technique but there are	
10:16		occasions when it is appropriate the	
10:20		bearings and distances listed in the	
10:22		body of the description would describe	
10:24		the parcel that extends beyond the	
10:26		property line but the portion actually	
10:29		conveyed would end at the property line	
10:32		the exception method can also be used in	
10:35		this case the preamble would state that	
10:39		portion of the southeast quarter of	
10:40		section 11 described as follows then the	
10:45		overlapping parcel would be described as	
10:47		in the inclusive method following that a	
10:50		statement would be added accepting there	
10:53		from any portion lying within section 12	
11:00		you need a plan before beginning to	
11:03		write here are some basic questions that	
11:07		must be answered before beginning the	
11:10		task of writing you were less likely to	
11:13		make errors	
11:14		if you systematically think your way	
11:16		through these questions before actually	
11:18		writing the description they won't all	
11:21		apply in every case but it is good to	
11:24		get in the habit of systematically	
11:26		considering each question to make sure	
11:29		nothing important is overlooked number	
11:33		one what kind of description is best	
11:36		number two what kind for the adjoining	
11:39		parcels number three what point is best	
11:44		for the point of beginning number four	
11:47		where should the basis of variance be	
11:49		established number five clockwise or	
11:54		counterclockwise number six what calls	
11:58		should be made number seven what clauses	
12:02		need to be added let's take a quick look	
12:06		at each of the seven questions to make	
12:07		sure that we understand them number one	
12:10		what kind of description is best we've	
12:15		Illustrated a number of types of	
12:17		descriptions that can be used depending	
12:19		on the need	
12:20		we've referred to them as tools in our	
12:23		toolbox if one doesn't fit perhaps	
12:26		another will number two what kind for	
12:31		the adjoining parcels when describing	
12:34		the right-of-way for support facilities	
12:36		like utilities or roads the requirements	
12:40		cross many property lines the techniques	
12:44		you use for two adjoining parcels need	
12:46		to be compatible if the descriptions for	
12:50		two adjoining parcels describe a common	
12:53		point on the property line in two	
12:55		different ways you're likely to wind up	
12:59		with a sawtooth right-of-way number	
13:03		three	
13:04		what point is best for the point of	
13:06		beginning remember that the point of	
13:09		beginning must be a record point or	
13:11		reference to one and there must be no	
13:14		doubt about its location the basis of	
13:17		bearings is normally established in the	
13:19		course that follows and the free line	
13:22		calls immediately after that if possible	
13:25		number four where should the basis of	
13:29		barians be established both ends of the	
13:34		line used for the basis of variance	
13:36		should be secure and not just one if the	
13:40		location of the entire description the	
13:43		location of the entire description is	
13:45		dependent on the location of the basis	
13:47		of bearings remember that the free line	
13:50		call should be made immediately after	
13:53		the basis of bearings if possible	
13:55		remember also that a bearing is a	
13:59		relative statement that has no meaning	
14:02		to the surveyor unless it can be related	
14:05		to a line in the field be sure to give a	
14:09		bearing for the line you have chosen for	
14:11		the basis of bearings and not just a	
14:14		general direction like easterly question	
14:19		number five clockwise or	
14:21		counterclockwise some people are under	
14:24		the impression that meets and bounds	
14:26		descriptions must be written in a	
14:28		clockwise fashion that is not true in	
14:32		fact clockwise is sometimes the wrong	
14:34		way to go remember that the free line	
14:38		calls need to be based securely on the	
14:41		best evidence which is normally the	
14:43		basis of bearings have you ever heard	
14:47		someone say that they took the ls exam	
14:49		and did pretty well but they failed to	
14:52		establish the basis of bearings on a	
14:54		description writing problem I have and	
14:57		I've heard it a number of times number	
15:00		six what call should be made remember we	
15:05		said that one of the errors the average	
15:07		surveyor is most likely to make is the	
15:09		failure to make appropriate title calls	
15:12		here is your chance to correct that	
15:16		systematically go through the	
15:17		description with this very question in	
15:20		mind that way you won't overlook an	
15:23		important call number seven what clauses	
15:27		need to be added there may be a need for	
15:31		an area clause a special basis of	
15:33		variants clause or a clause to clarify	
15:35		what happens to the sidelines of a strip	
15:38		of land	
15:38		don't take a chance on overlooking one	
15:41		that is needed now let's take a look at	
15:46		some sample descriptions and plan the	
15:48		tasks using the seven questions we've	
15:50		just introduced what better place to get	
15:53		the sample questions and the LS exams	
15:56		from previous years we'll study a number	
15:59		of them beginning with the 1977 exam you	
16:03		have copies of these problems as they	
16:05		appeared on the exams in your workbook	
16:08		you will also find a copy of the	
16:10		planning the task list of questions	
16:13		there you may want to stop the tape now	
16:16		and find them so you will have them	
16:18		before you as we go you'll find it	
16:21		helpful because the drawings we show on	
16:23		the screen have been edited a bit ready	
16:28		okay let's go 1977 exam problem C for	
16:34		the drawing is described as a parcel of	
16:38		land identified as track one of man	
16:40		subdivision per map book 3 page 17	
16:43		records of such-and-such a County	
16:45		California	
16:47		we are further told that the bearings	
16:49		and distances not shown are not to be	
16:52		assumed or calculated and we are to	
16:55		disregard possible requirements for a	
16:57		parcel map we are to write a meets and	
17:01		bounds description for each of the three	
17:03		parcels to be cut out of the track we	
17:07		can assume that all of the lot lines and	
17:09		corners are good so we don't have to be	
17:11		concerned about pedigree of corners in	
17:13		this problem not all of the seven	
17:17		questions will apply here but it is good	
17:19		practice to get in the habit of checking	
17:21		each one we're required to write a meets	
17:25		and bounds description for each of the	
17:27		three so question number one has been	
17:29		answered for us question two what kind	
17:33		for the adjoining parcels and number	
17:35		seven what clauses need to be added do	
17:38		not apply here and can be disregarded	
17:41		the remaining four questions do apply	
17:44		however and need to be considered let's	
17:48		apply each of the four questions to each	
17:51		of the three parcels parcel a a preamble	
17:56		is called for in this one it would read	
17:59		like this that portion of track one of	
18:02		man's subdivision according to map	
18:04		recorded in book three page 17 of maps	
18:07		and the official records of such in such	
18:09		a County California described as follows	
18:13		now question number three what point is	
18:17		best for the point of beginning the	
18:19		point of beginning must be at or related	
18:23		to one of the tract corners it really	
18:26		could be any of the tract corners but	
18:29		the BC and EC of the curve as well as	
18:32		the most northerly corner would lead to	
18:34		some awkward wording the South line of	
18:38		parsley is tied to the southwest and	
18:40		southeast corners so we'll have to refer	
18:43		to them anyway in order to set the South	
18:45		line of our slave let's use one of them	
18:48		and describe it as follows beginning at	
18:52		a point on the northwesterly line of	
18:54		said tract one distant northeasterly	
18:57		along said line 510 point zero zero feet	
19:01		from the South Westerley corner of said	
19:04		tract this that's the point of beginning	
19:08		at a point on the northwesterly line of	
19:10		the track reference to the southwest	
19:13		corner of the tract a record corner that	
19:17		will satisfy the surveyor the title	
19:20		person and the judge question number	
19:24		four where should the basis of bearings	
19:26		be established actually a basis of	
19:30		bearings in the conventional sense is	
19:32		not needed on this parcel because the	
19:35		South line of the parcel will be set	
19:37		between two fixed points and all of the	
19:41		other courses will be along existing	
19:43		tidal lines there are no bearings used	
19:47		except the general directions like	
19:48		northerly northwesterly etc the normal	
19:52		place to begin a basis of variance to	
19:55		establish a basis of bearings would be	
19:57		the northwest line of the track where a	
19:59		direction is given from the track corner	
20:02		to the point of beginning	
20:03		here again if there were bearings on	
20:06		each of the straight lines on the track	
20:09		boundary and a calculated bearing on the	
20:12		South line of parcel a it would be	
20:15		essential to give the bearing of the	
20:18		northwesterly line of the tract and not	
20:20		just the general direction north	
20:23		easterly so that the angle of	
20:26		intersection between the track line and	
20:28		the South line of parcel a can be	
20:31		determined number five clockwise or	
20:36		counterclockwise either would work in	
20:40		this case but it is good to get in the	
20:41		habit of describing free line calls	
20:43		first so I would choose counterclockwise	
20:47		number six what calls should be made a	
20:51		call must be made to a specific point on	
20:54		the East line of the track just as in	
20:56		describing the pob and calls must be	
21:00		made along the track boundary wherever	
21:02		the description Traverse did the	
21:05		description might read like this after	
21:07		describing the POB thence easterly to a	
21:11		point on the East line of said track	
21:13		distant northerly along said East line	
21:17		50.000 nerve said tract thence	
21:22		northerly along said East line to the	
21:25		most northerly corner of said track	
21:27		thence westerly and southwesterly along	
21:30		the general northerly and northwesterly	
21:33		line of said tract to the point of	
21:35		beginning parcel B question number three	
21:42		what point is best for the point of	
21:45		beginning it would be natural to use the	
21:48		southwest corner of the track for the	
21:50		point of beginning but when we think	
21:52		ahead to question number six what calls	
21:55		to make we will see an advantage to	
21:58		doing it a little differently the only	
22:00		way we have of describing the curve	
22:02		forming the northeasterly line of the	
22:05		parcel is to describe it as passing	
22:08		through two specific points one on the	
22:11		northwesterly line of the track and the	
22:14		other on the southerly line	
22:16		let's describe the pob as beginning at a	
22:20		point on the southerly line of said	
22:23		track one distant easterly 300.000 head	
22:29		southerly line from the southwest corner	
22:31		of said track one question for where	
22:37		should the basis of barians be	
22:38		established again this is not needed	
22:42		because the one free line is tied to two	
22:45		fixed points the normal place for the	
22:48		basis of barians however would be the	
22:50		south line of the track question five	
22:55		clockwise or counterclockwise since we	
22:59		have already begun on the south line of	
23:01		the track we will have to go clockwise	
23:04		in order to set the point on the	
23:06		northwesterly line of the track if we	
23:10		had begun at that point on the	
23:12		northwesterly line of the track we would	
23:14		have had to go counterclockwise number	
23:18		six what calls should be made the two	
23:22		points through which the curve passes	
23:24		must be specifically described in one	
23:27		way or another also calls must be made	
23:31		along the two track lines and the track	
23:34		corner must be called because the curve	
23:37		passes through points that are tied to	
23:39		the corner the portion of the	
23:42		description that follows the point of	
23:44		beginning might read like this thence	
23:48		westerly along said southerly line	
23:51		00.000 scorner of said track one thence	
23:57		northeasterly along the northwesterly	
23:59		line of said track one 350.000 a non	
24:05		tangent curve concave southwesterly	
24:08		having the radius of 500 point zero zero	
24:11		feet stead curve also passing through	
24:15		the point of beginning thence	
24:17		southeasterly along said curve to the	
24:20		point of beginning parcel seve beginning	
24:26		with question number three again what	
24:29		point is bad	
24:29		for the point of beginning here again	
24:32		we'll have to be a bit creative as we	
24:34		were in parcel be the only controls we	
24:37		have here are the four distances the	
24:40		location of the track corner and the two	
24:43		track lines there is no direction given	
24:46		for the two sides with lengths of 147	
24:50		feet and 210 feet so the distances	
24:53		themselves will have to control in order	
24:57		to do that we will have to tie those two	
24:59		sides to fixed points on the two track	
25:02		lines let's begin at the southwest	
25:05		corner of parcel seed it may sound like	
25:08		this beginning at a point on the South	
25:12		line of said track one distant westerly	
25:15		alone said South line 200 points 0 0	
25:18		feet from the southeast corner of said	
25:21		track number 4 where should the basis of	
25:25		bearings be established same answer is	
25:29		in parcel B no bearings are used so none	
25:31		as needed number 5 clockwise or	
25:36		counterclockwise our point of beginning	
25:39		has set one of the control points which	
25:41		will control the location of the	
25:43		northerly and westerly sides but we must	
25:47		set the other one before those two sides	
25:49		can be described we'll have to go	
25:52		counterclockwise in this case note that	
25:56		if we had placed the point of beginning	
25:57		on the East line of the tract we would	
26:00		have had to go clockwise number 6 what	
26:04		call should be made the tract corner and	
26:07		the two tract lines again the two	
26:11		specific points on the track lines need	
26:14		to be described in one way or another	
26:16		the portion of the description following	
26:19		the point of beginning might read like	
26:21		this thence easterly along said south	
26:25		line of said track 200 point zero zero	
26:28		two the southeast corner of said track	
26:30		thence northerly along the East line of	
26:34		said track 150.000 zero feet to a point	
26:42		that is this	
26:42		and 140 7.00 feet from the point of	
26:47		beginning then southerly 140 7.00 feet	
26:52		to the point of beginning 1978 exam	
26:57		problem c1 we're asked to calculate	
27:02		dimensions and write a legal description	
27:04		for that portion of the south half of	
27:06		the south east quarter of the southeast	
27:08		quarter of section 22 line east of Pratt	
27:12		Road dimensions are given to and along	
27:15		the centerline of the road so dimensions	
27:18		to and along the east line of the road	
27:20		will have to be calculated I'll leave	
27:23		that part to you but we can plan the	
27:26		task by asking our questions of the	
27:28		parcel before we start to write number	
27:31		one what kind of parcel of a description	
27:33		is best the problem calls for a meets	
27:37		and bounds description a line	
27:40		description would be tempting otherwise	
27:42		it would read that portion of the south	
27:45		half of the southeast quarter of the	
27:48		southeast quarter of section 22 lying	
27:51		east of Pratt Road as described in deed	
27:53		etc	
27:56		question 2 what kind for the adjoining	
27:58		parcels to truly locate the subject	
28:03		parcel we would have to properly break	
28:05		down the section which would require	
28:08		more than the one monument shown we must	
28:11		assume for the purposes of this problem	
28:14		that the dimensions and bearings of the	
28:16		sides of this parcel are correct as	
28:19		shown if there were some question as to	
28:23		the true location of the North line of	
28:25		the subject parcel then when writing a	
28:28		description for the parcel just north of	
28:30		ours we would have to be careful so that	
28:34		we would not end up with two locations	
28:37		for the intersection of the east line of	
28:39		the road and the North line of the	
28:41		subject parcel number three what point	
28:45		is best for the point of beginning as we	
28:49		have just stated the true location of	
28:52		the North line of the south half of	
28:54		southeast quarter of the southeast	
28:56		quarter of any section is dependent on	
28:59		the section breakdown which in turn is	
29:01		dependent on several monuments a line	
29:05		like that is not normally a good place	
29:07		to start a description the section	
29:09		corner is the obvious place to begin	
29:12		number four where should the basis of	
29:15		bearings be established the south line	
29:18		of the section looks good because then	
29:20		we can describe the side line of the	
29:22		road immediately after establishing the	
29:24		basis of bearings remember that in order	
29:27		to establish a basis of bearings we will	
29:30		have to say along the south line of said	
29:33		section and also give the bearing of the	
29:37		line south 89 degrees 32 minutes west	
29:43		just calling along the section line even	
29:46		with a general direction is not enough	
29:49		number five clockwise or	
29:51		counterclockwise it really would not	
29:55		matter since every course in this	
29:56		description will be along an existing	
29:59		tidal line in other words there are no	
30:02		free line calls that need to be based	
30:04		clearly on the basis of bearings an old	
30:08		habit however would lead me to go	
30:10		clockwise so that the new property line	
30:13		the east line of the existing Pratt Road	
30:16		could be described	
30:18		immediately after the basis of bearings	
30:20		number six what calls should be made the	
30:25		section corner would have to be	
30:27		described of course the monument could	
30:30		be described if desired but it is not	
30:32		necessary they call for a physical	
30:35		monument as a double call and usually	
30:38		results in more trouble than it is worth	
30:41		the first call first course would have	
30:44		to call along the section line and to	
30:48		the east line of the road as described	
30:51		in the deed that created it the next	
30:53		three courses would have to call along	
30:56		the east line of that road and the last	
30:59		of those three courses would have to	
31:00		call to the north line of the south half	
31:03		of the southeast quarter of the	
31:05		southeast quarter of the section which	
31:07		is the property	
31:08		the following course would have to call	
31:11		along that North line to the east line	
31:14		of the section the last course would	
31:17		have to call a long set east line of a	
31:20		section to the point of beginning all of	
31:24		the distances and all of the bearings	
31:27		except the one in the South line of the	
31:30		section would have to yield if necessary	
31:32		because of these title calls number	
31:36		seven what clauses need to be added the	
31:41		problem states that area is not required	
31:43		and there doesn't appear to be a need	
31:45		for any others	
31:47		now the 1984 exam problem d5 we're asked	
31:54		here to write a description for a twenty	
31:56		acre parcel in the Northeast quarter of	
31:58		section 11 the drawing indicates that no	
32:01		monument was found for the northwest	
32:03		corner of the section but the other	
32:05		section corner monuments and all of the	
32:07		quarter corner monuments were found note	
32:10		that the only monuments needed to break	
32:13		out the northeast quarter of the section	
32:15		are the four quarter corner monuments	
32:17		and the one at the northeast corner of	
32:20		the section the dimensions also indicate	
32:23		that it is a conveniently square	
32:25		standard section so we can conclude that	
32:28		normal federal break down procedures can	
32:31		be followed the description would read	
32:34		the west half of the northwest quarter	
32:38		of the northeast quarter of section 11	
32:41		Township 10 south range to west mount	
32:44		the habló meridian in the county of	
32:46		santa cruz state of California as shown	
32:49		on the official plant thereof on file in	
32:51		the office of the Bureau of Land	
32:53		Management	
32:55		there should be an approval date for the	
32:57		official plat but none is given 1984	
33:02		exam problem D 6 here we have four	
33:06		situations where our list of questions	
33:08		really do not apply these are the kinds	
33:12		we refer to as of descriptions because	
33:14		that word is always the key ingredient	
33:17		there are some important rules and	
33:19		prints	
33:20		to learn however so let's take a look at	
33:22		the drawings one at a time and learn	
33:24		what to look for and what techniques	
33:26		work number one our first drawing is a	
33:31		parallelogram to be divided in half by	
33:33		area the west half is to be conveyed	
33:37		first and the east half later the real	
33:42		challenge here is how to describe the	
33:44		dividing line in such a way that each of	
33:47		the two descriptions would place it in	
33:50		the same location remember that there is	
33:53		no fixed rule in state law that dictates	
33:56		for instance where the East line of the	
33:58		West half should be placed it must	
34:01		result in dividing the parcel in half by	
34:04		area but that's all the law requires	
34:07		good surveying practice recommend	
34:10		certain procedures depending on the	
34:13		nature of the parcel note that the left	
34:16		and right side lines are not parallel	
34:19		that could lead to some confusion as to	
34:22		where to place the dividing line if a	
34:23		simple description the West one half of	
34:26		lot 7 were used some would make the	
34:30		dividing line parallel with the West	
34:31		line of the lot but others would use a	
34:34		mean of the bearings for the west and	
34:36		east lines of the lot therefore it is	
34:39		important to specify exactly how to set	
34:43		that dividing line and use the same	
34:46		language in each of the two descriptions	
34:49		we might say this for the first parts	
34:52		will convey the West one half lot 7 the	
34:56		East line being parallel with the West	
34:58		line of said lot the second parcel	
35:02		conveyed then would read like this the	
35:05		East one half of lot 7 the West line of	
35:09		said East one half being parallel with	
35:12		the West line of said lot number two the	
35:17		first description the North 75 point	
35:22		zero zero feet of lot n of etc would do	
35:26		the job that language would result in	
35:29		the south line being parallel with the	
35:31		North line of the	
35:34		second description the North line of	
35:38		this piece is not parallel with the	
35:40		South line of the lot because the east	
35:42		and west lines of the piece are both 75	
35:46		feet and the two lines are not nearly	
35:48		parallel we could say that portion of	
35:52		lot 10 lines southerly of a line	
35:55		connecting a point on the East line of	
35:57		said lot distant northerly along said	
36:00		East line 75 point zero zero feet from	
36:03		the southeast corner of said lot with a	
36:06		point on the west line of said lot	
36:09		distant along said West line northerly	
36:12		5 point zero zero feet from the	
36:15		southwest corner of said lot or we could	
36:18		write a meets and bounds description	
36:19		beginning at either of the two southerly	
36:22		lot corners in running in either	
36:24		direction around the parcel using	
36:27		general directions and calls along the	
36:29		lot lines where appropriate	
36:31		it would also cite the two 75 foot	
36:34		dimensions where they apply the third	
36:38		description this conveyance would	
36:42		include whatever is left it would read	
36:45		like this lot 10 of whatever except the	
36:49		north seventy five point zero zero feet	
36:51		of said lot also accepting that portion	
36:56		thereof described as follows	
36:58		here you had repeat what was said in the	
37:01		second deed number three the first	
37:07		description gets the dividing gets to	
37:09		set the dividing line and the other deed	
37:12		will describe what was left this is how	
37:14		it might sound first one would read the	
37:18		east for point fifteen acres of lot	
37:21		three of whatever the second would read	
37:24		lot three of etc except the east 4.15	
37:30		acres thereof the west line of the 4.15	
37:36		acres would be set parallel with the	
37:38		east line of the lot because that line	
37:41		is nearly cardinal in direction the	
37:44		location of the east line of	
37:46		West half of this lot would be unclear	
37:48		because the West line of the lot is not	
37:51		nearly in a cardinal direction number	
37:55		four	
37:57		note that this lot is somewhat near	
38:01		square and the opposite sides look	
38:03		parallel it's the south easterly two	
38:08		acres that need to be described note	
38:12		also that the problem is only worth two	
38:15		points	
38:16		an inexperienced writer could easily	
38:18		spend much more time on this one and the	
38:21		two points they're worth will have to be	
38:24		a bit creative with this one	
38:25		note that the opposite sides of the two	
38:28		acre parcels seem to be parallel and all	
38:31		four sides seem to be about the same	
38:34		length perhaps we can use those facts in	
38:38		composing a description the south	
38:42		easterly 2.0 acres of lot 13 of the	
38:47		southerly and easterly side lines of	
38:50		said two-acre parcel being of equal	
38:52		length and the northerly and westerly	
38:56		side lines being parallel with the	
38:59		southerly and easterly lines	
39:00		respectively of said lot the remainder	
39:05		of the lot would be described as lot 13	
39:08		of etc except and then described the two	
39:13		acre parcel 1986 exam problem a3 the	
39:21		problem described an approved Canada	
39:23		parcel map with the final parcel map	
39:26		waived in other words we can forget	
39:28		about the parcel map the problem is to	
39:31		write four separate descriptions in such	
39:35		a way that they are compatible with one	
39:37		another one is for a proposed county	
39:40		road which is to be recorded first and	
39:42		the other three are for three proposed	
39:45		parcels that are to abut upon the road	
39:48		the problem further states that the	
39:50		bearings and dimensions shown are either	
39:53		record or calculated from record and do	
39:56		not come from a survey the	
39:59		scriptures are to be written in such a	
40:01		way that if a later survey found the	
40:03		bearings and dimensions to be different	
40:05		the descriptions would still fit neatly	
40:08		together let's apply the seven questions	
40:13		from the planning attached section to	
40:16		the description required for the road	
40:18		easement since that one has to be	
40:20		recorded first what kind of description	
40:24		is best number one the road easement is	
40:27		a strip of land of uniform width using a	
40:30		dimension centerline the obvious choice	
40:33		is to use a strip description number two	
40:36		what kind for the adjoining parcels all	
40:39		of the three other descriptions will	
40:41		abut upon the road in fact since the	
40:44		road is an easement the centerline of	
40:47		the road will be the property line	
40:48		between parcel three on one side and	
40:51		parcels one and two on the other since	
40:54		the road easement will be recorded first	
40:56		any number of types of description could	
40:59		be used for the other three number three	
41:03		what point is best for the point of	
41:05		beginning it could start at the point	
41:10		where the center line intersects the	
41:11		North line or the South line of existing	
41:14		lot 18 whichever point is chosen that	
41:17		should be reference to one of the lot	
41:19		corners if the description begins at the	
41:23		South line your description will have to	
41:25		begin with a curve note that the radial	
41:29		bearing is given there it might be	
41:32		easier to begin at the point on the	
41:34		North line of the lot number for worship	
41:39		the basis of bearings be established	
41:41		here is an easy place to make a mistake	
41:44		by failing to properly establish a basis	
41:47		of bearings it should normally be	
41:49		established in the first course we might	
41:53		say beginning at a point on the North	
41:56		line of said lot eighteen distant along	
41:59		said line North 89 degrees east 240.000	
42:05		owner of said lot eighteen failing to	
42:09		give the bearing along the North line	
42:11		would be a mistake	
42:14		number five clockwise or	
42:16		counterclockwise this question really	
42:19		does not apply in this case number six	
42:22		what call should be made the basis of	
42:26		bearings should call along whichever lot	
42:29		line is used and at the end of the	
42:32		description the call must be made to the	
42:35		other lot line	
42:36		what clauses should be added the clause	
42:40		should be added explaining how and where	
42:42		the side lines of the strip are to	
42:44		terminate the clause is needed here	
42:48		because the described line terminates at	
42:50		the lot line and some might assume that	
42:53		the side line should terminate at a line	
42:55		at right angles or radially to the	
42:57		centre line passing through the point of	
43:00		termination there we have it the	
43:03		preamble would not mention the parcel	
43:05		map because it does not exist	
43:07		the parcel would be described as a	
43:09		portion of Lata 18 track 400 etcetera	
43:15		now for price of one question number one	
43:18		what description what kind of	
43:21		description is best most people would	
43:24		choose a meets and bounds description so	
43:26		let's use that a line description could	
43:29		be used as well calling for that portion	
43:32		of said lot 18 line westerly of the	
43:35		previously recorded road easement and	
43:37		northerly of the following described	
43:40		line and then follow with a description	
43:43		of the common line between parcels 1 & 2	
43:46		question 2 what kind for the adjoining	
43:49		parcel this is an important question for	
43:52		this parcel because the line between it	
43:55		and parcel two must fall in the same	
43:59		location from each of the descriptions	
44:02		even if a later survey showed that the	
44:05		bearings and dimensions we are using are	
44:07		wrong the only way to make sure that the	
44:10		South line of parcel 1 will be in the	
44:13		same place at the North line of parcel 2	
44:16		is to use the same identical language in	
44:20		each description we should use a meets	
44:23		and bounds description for parcel 2 as	
44:25		well	
44:26		but the point of beginning the basis of	
44:29		bearings and the description of the	
44:31		common line must be identical in each	
44:34		description number three point of	
44:37		beginning the point of beginning should	
44:40		be the west end of the common line	
44:42		reference to one of the lot corners	
44:45		let's call it a point on the common line	
44:50		give me let's call it a point on the	
44:52		West line of said lot eighteen distant	
44:55		along said line north one degree west	
44:58		50.000 scorner of lot eighteen number	
45:06		four basis of bearings the basis of	
45:09		bearings should be the West line of lot	
45:12		eighteen and should include a call along	
45:14		the line as well as a bearing and	
45:16		distance number five clockwise or	
45:21		counterclockwise counterclockwise so	
45:24		that the free line called the common	
45:26		line is described first number six what	
45:30		calls should be made to and along the	
45:34		center line of the road easement to and	
45:36		along the North line of the lot and to	
45:39		and along the west line back to the	
45:41		point of beginning number seven what	
45:46		clauses need to be added not parcel to	
45:52		we've already shown that the same	
45:55		identical language should be used here	
45:57		for the point of beginning the basis of	
45:59		bearings and the description of the	
46:00		common line therefore this one much must	
46:04		read in a clockwise direction and calls	
46:08		made to and along the center line of the	
46:10		road easement and then to and along the	
46:13		south and west lines of the lot back to	
46:15		the point of beginning if flying	
46:18		descriptions were decided on four	
46:20		parcels one and two the common line	
46:23		would be described in the same way tying	
46:25		it to a point on the west line of lot	
46:28		eighteen distant the same bearing and	
46:31		distance from the same lot corner in	
46:33		each case then the description for	
46:36		parcel one would read that portion	
46:39		lotta 18 etc line westerly of the road	
46:43		and line northerly of the following	
46:46		described line the 1/4 parcel to would	
46:50		read the same except for the fact that	
46:52		it would read southerly of the following	
46:54		describe line instead of northerly	
46:59		parcel 3 this one could be a line	
47:03		description calling for that portion a	
47:05		lot 18 lying	
47:06		easterly of the road or it could be a	
47:08		meets and bounds description beginning	
47:10		at one of the lot corners and reading in	
47:13		either direction with calls to and along	
47:15		all the lot lines and the road 1991 exam	
47:21		problem b1 here's another good test for	
47:26		our list of 7 questions	
47:28		it is also an occasion to use the	
47:31		miscellaneous clauses you have in your	
47:33		workbook using standard language to	
47:36		describe some of the tricky situations	
47:38		we face will make your work much easier	
47:42		let's go through the questions number	
47:45		one what kind of description is best	
47:48		that question there really been decided	
47:51		for us in this case it will have to be a	
47:54		descript description remember however	
47:57		that there are a number of ways of	
47:58		describing the strip of land as you will	
48:00		see in miscellaneous clauses section of	
48:03		your workbook it would be helpful to	
48:06		quickly review the possibilities before	
48:08		writing for instance the centerline of a	
48:12		strip can be described but that would	
48:15		necessitate a call to a parallel line	
48:17		towards the end of the description it is	
48:20		also possible to use a sideline	
48:22		description using the right-hand side	
48:24		line of the strip looking in the	
48:26		direction of the traverse that would	
48:29		eliminate the need to call to a parallel	
48:31		line however you will find a sample of a	
48:35		call to a parallel line in your workbook	
48:37		so let's use the center line some of the	
48:40		data needs to be calculated of course	
48:43		number two what kind for adjoining	
48:46		parcels we're not required to write any	
48:49		of the adjoining descriptions but if and	
48:51		when they	
48:52		were written they would certainly be	
48:54		strip descriptions as well number three	
48:57		what point is best for the point of	
48:59		beginning the problem requires that we	
49:02		begin the description at the southwest	
49:04		corner of section five so that much is	
49:07		decided for us however the actual	
49:11		conveyance begins east of there where	
49:14		the strip intersects the south line of	
49:16		the section so let's use the section	
49:18		corner as a point of commencement and	
49:21		the point where the conveyance begins as	
49:24		the true point of beginning here's how	
49:27		the preamble and the first course might	
49:29		be written that portion of the Southwest	
49:32		quarter of section five Township seven	
49:34		north range twelve East Mount Diablo	
49:38		Meridian according to official plant	
49:40		thereof consisting of a strip of land	
49:43		0.00 feet wide line twenty point zero	
49:47		zero feet on each side of the following	
49:50		described line commencing at the	
49:53		southwest corner of said section five	
49:56		thence east four hundred forty one point	
49:59		zero zero feet along the south line of	
50:02		said section two the true point of	
50:04		beginning the next course may be a	
50:07		challenge for some because it requires	
50:09		describing a non tangent curve to start	
50:12		the strip description that can be a bit	
50:15		intimidating for inexperienced writers	
50:18		but remember it's in the book once again	
50:22		your workbook has samples of how this is	
50:25		done find the sample that seems to fit	
50:28		the situation and adapt it to fit number	
50:32		four where should the basis of bearings	
50:34		be established the basis of bearings was	
50:37		established when we called along the	
50:39		section line and gave a bearing as well	
50:42		number five clockwise or	
50:45		counterclockwise this question really	
50:47		applies only in meats and bound	
50:49		descriptions number six what call should	
50:53		be made the southwest corner of the	
50:56		section the south line of the section	
50:58		the south line of parcel a of the parcel	
51:01		map and the west line of the section the	
51:04		call to the South line of parcel a of	
51:07		the parcel map must result in the strip	
51:09		of buddying upon the south line of	
51:12		parcel egg number seven what clauses	
51:16		need to be added will need to add a	
51:21		clause to make sure that the side length	
51:23		of the strip beginning and where we want	
51:25		them to again there are samples in the	
51:28		workbook it might sound like this	
51:31		the side lines of said strip at the	
51:33		beginning of said description shall be	
51:35		continued or shortened so as as	
51:39		necessary so as to begin at the South	
51:42		line of said section and at the end of	
51:44		said description said side lines shall	
51:47		be prolonged or shortened as necessary	
51:50		so as to terminate at the west line of	
51:52		said section note that we use the term	
51:56		continued at the beginning of the strip	
51:59		and the word prolonged at the end this	
52:02		is because curved lines are continued	
52:05		and straight lines are prolonged well	
52:09		there you have it the planning the	
52:13		tasked exercise should help you think	
52:15		through the major problems you'll	
52:17		encounter before you start to write not	
52:20		all of the questions will apply in every	
52:22		case but it's good to get in the habit	
52:24		of going through the checklist every	
52:26		time also remember again to get	
52:30		acquainted with as many standard	
52:32		acceptable tested ways of saying certain	
52:34		things as you can you'll find the number	
52:38		of them in your workbook and you'll find	
52:40		others in other places don't try to	
52:42		memorize them but index them and learn	
52:45		how to find the ones you need in a hurry	
52:49		study the techniques and principles	
52:52		we've talked about and practice writing	
52:54		legal descriptions practice particularly	
52:57		how to find samples	
53:00		quickly and be able to use them now as	
53:04		the saying goes that's all folks the	
53:07		rest is up to you good luck with your	
53:10		test
