00:50	welcome to Caltrans lsit Els exam
00:53	preparation course one aid in your
00:56	preparation for California licensure
00:58	examinations a word of caution don't use
01:02	this course as your only preparation
01:05	devise and follow a regular schedule of
01:08	study which begins months before the
01:10	test what many problems in each area not
01:15	just those in this courses workbook but
01:18	problems from other sources as well this
01:21	course is funded by Caltrans but you and
01:25	I owe a profound thanks to others the
01:28	courses instructors from the academic
01:30	community the private sector other
01:33	public agencies and from Caltrans as
01:36	well we wish you well in your study
01:39	toward becoming a member of California's
01:41	professional land surveying community
01:46	hello i'm down to na Frio with the
01:48	national geodetic survey i am presently
01:51	serving as the national geodetic survey
01:53	coordinator to the california department
01:54	of transportation this is one of a
01:57	series of presentations aimed at
01:58	providing information to assist you in
02:00	preparing for the professional land
02:02	surveyors examination for the next hour
02:04	I will be speaking about issues related
02:07	to the global positioning system or GPS
02:09	because of the complexity of the
02:11	technology and the rapid evolutionary
02:14	changes I will touch briefly on a
02:16	variety of issues associated with the
02:18	technology my intent will be to raise
02:21	your level of awareness about the use of
02:23	GPS I urge you to accept the technology
02:26	for the capabilities it brings to the
02:28	surveying profession I would also like
02:30	to make two points at the beginning
02:32	first GPS is not yet the answer to all
02:36	surveying needs and secondly it is
02:39	possible to miss apply the technology
02:41	with this in mind I would like to begin
02:44	by giving you a brief outline of what I
02:46	plan to discuss in the presentation I
02:48	will begin with a brief history of
02:49	satellite geodesy or satellite surveying
02:52	then I will discuss how we use GPS to
02:55	extend control and survey coordinates
02:57	and to survey project areas I will
03:00	discuss some of the methodologies or
03:01	satellite
03:02	such as static positioning kinematic
03:05	positioning and pseudo kinematic
03:07	positioning methodologies I will then
03:09	discuss issues associated with project
03:11	planning and the next element will be
03:13	the use of GPS for establishing vertical
03:16	control I will then discuss the recently
03:19	completed statewide precision GPS
03:21	Network established by Caltrans and NGS
03:24	cooperatively I will conclude with a
03:27	discussion on the latest methodology
03:28	developments and GPS position there is
03:32	one issue I want to stress here and will
03:34	probably do so throughout this
03:35	presentation GPS is still in its
03:38	evolutionary phase new methods are
03:41	continually being investigated the
03:43	primary driving force behind the
03:45	evolution is how the technology can be
03:47	used to provide greater accuracy or how
03:50	it can be used to provide a given level
03:51	of accuracy in a shorter period of time
03:54	I think you will find that all of the
03:56	advancements in the use of GPS meet
03:59	either one or both of these criteria
04:02	before moving into the presentation I
04:04	would like to discuss the term geodesy
04:07	and its relationship to the types of
04:09	surveying many of you may be associated
04:11	with in your careers as surveyors
04:14	many survey projects are relatively
04:16	limited in scope in performing these
04:18	surveys it is often practical consider
04:21	the area as a plain surface as projects
04:25	become larger in scope and larger in
04:27	area one can no longer use this
04:29	assumption since the earth is not flat
04:31	one must take into account allowances
04:34	for curvature geodetic surveying takes
04:37	into account the size and shape of the
04:38	earth as you get involved with GPS
04:41	surveys you will need to understand this
04:43	concept now moving into a brief history
04:47	of satellite geodesy it may be difficult
04:49	to understand how a seemingly new
04:51	technology can burst onto the scene and
04:53	achieve the accuracy is attributed to
04:55	the global positioning system in fact
04:58	GPS is the next step in a series of
05:00	satellite positioning technologies
05:02	started about thirty years ago
05:04	I will spend a very few minutes on this
05:06	brief history it can be broken down into
05:09	three basic phases the early years the
05:12	960s the Doppler years the nineteen
05:15	and the GPS years the 1980s and beyond
05:18	in the early years accuracies were
05:21	probably no better than about five
05:23	meters there were four systems in use at
05:25	that time two of the systems were
05:27	electronic the early Doppler system run
05:30	by the Navy and the sea core system run
05:33	by the army seeker standing for the
05:35	sequential collation of range and there
05:37	were two systems which were
05:38	photogrammetric the BC four system run
05:41	by the coast and geodetic survey the
05:43	precursor to the National geodetic
05:44	survey and the PC 1000 system used by
05:48	the US Air Force in the 1970s the
05:52	transit navigation system had an
05:53	improved and miniaturized Doppler
05:55	receiver the geo sivir provided
05:58	accuracies approaching 1/2 meter until
06:01	the advent of the global positioning
06:02	system these accuracies were not capable
06:05	of meeting survey requirements for all
06:08	but a few applications the global
06:11	positioning system was a natural
06:12	evolution in satellite positioning
06:14	technology it is in many respects
06:17	similar to the Doppler system it is the
06:20	differences among these similarities
06:22	which enable us to achieve these
06:24	remarkable accuracies with GPS Doppler
06:27	satellites were in a very low polar
06:29	orbit gps satellites are in a very high
06:31	orbit about 20,000 kilometers and
06:34	deployed in a series of orbital planes
06:36	six orbital planes to be exact
06:39	Doppler satellites were equipped with
06:41	less accurate rubidium frequency
06:43	standards gps satellites are equipped
06:45	with highly accurate cesium or atomic
06:47	clocks doppler satellites broadcast at
06:50	relatively low frequencies at 150 and
06:53	00 megahertz and gps satellites
06:56	broadcast at significantly higher
06:58	frequencies 1200 and 1500 megahertz and
07:01	there were only six Doppler satellites
07:03	compared to the proposed 24 gps
07:06	satellites of equal significance was the
07:09	ability of the gps receivers to track up
07:11	to 12 satellites both frequencies
07:14	simultaneously the Doppler gia sivir was
07:16	only able to track one satellite at a
07:18	time the foregoing is simply to let you
07:21	know that some of the aspects of GPS
07:23	technology did not just burst onto the
07:26	scene but they they were a part of an
07:28	ongoing evolution of satellite
07:29	positioning technology a similar now a
07:32	similar analogy could be made in the
07:34	evolution of electronic distance
07:36	measuring equipment as we move from
07:38	microwave to light wave to to color
07:40	laser geometer for example it is
07:43	difficult to envision another
07:45	evolutionary advance beyond the GPS
07:47	system the advances which are being made
07:49	seem to be more in the development of
07:51	software which continues to improve and
07:54	which seems to be taking the GPS
07:56	technology far beyond what was
07:58	originally intended some of these
08:00	advances will be discussed in this
08:02	presentation some of the advances are in
08:04	current everyday use and some of them
08:07	have been demonstrated but are not yet
08:08	suitably documented and tested for use
08:11	by the surveying community in a
08:13	production mode before going further
08:17	into the discussion I would like to give
08:18	you an oversimplified view of how the
08:20	basic GPS technology works each
08:23	satellite broadcast a signal which is
08:25	received by a suitable GPS receiver if
08:29	we know the time a signal is broadcast
08:31	from the satellite very accurately and
08:34	we know the time the same signal was
08:36	received at the receiver we can
08:38	determine the distance or range from the
08:40	satellite how do we know this range well
08:44	we know that these signals travel at the
08:45	speed of light 186,000 miles per second
08:48	thus we multiply the speed of light by
08:51	the fraction of a second it takes the
08:53	signal to travel from the satellite to
08:54	the receiver
08:56	if we could measure the time to as
08:59	accurate as a microsecond we would still
09:01	have an inaccuracy of almost 300 meters
09:03	along this line but if we have the
09:06	ability to measure signal simultaneously
09:07	from more than one satellite we know
09:10	that we are at the intersection of the
09:12	lines connecting the respective
09:14	satellites to the receivers if it was
09:17	this simple we would all be out doing
09:18	GPS surveys but it is in fact almost as
09:22	simple when we employ suitably designed
09:23	GPS receivers fast computers and
09:26	reliable software there are a number of
09:30	technical terms used in conjunction with
09:32	GPS tracking and operations I will not
09:34	use some of the terms in this
09:35	presentation my purpose here in this
09:38	limited-time is to provide you with some
09:40	idea
09:41	of how the technology is used in survey
09:43	applications different methodologies
09:46	take advantage of some of these more
09:48	specific issues these terms are
09:50	explained in the materials accompanying
09:52	this video you cannot have a complete
09:54	understanding of the technology and how
09:56	best to apply it to your needs without
09:58	an understanding of these terms for
10:01	purposes of this presentation we will
10:04	focus on those issues related to GPS as
10:07	a surveying technology rather than
10:09	include GPS as a navigation technology
10:12	navigation generally implies point
10:15	positioning with a single receiver
10:17	generally this category of receivers is
10:19	not used to provide survey accuracies
10:22	however you should understand that some
10:24	of these GPS receivers have been
10:26	designed for and are being used by
10:29	geographic information system GIS
10:31	proponents for a variety of positioning
10:34	applications which may not require
10:36	survey accuracies this is not to imply
10:39	the GIS should not ultimately be based
10:41	on accurate survey coordinates surveying
10:44	generally employs GPS and the
10:45	differential or relative mode that is
10:48	two or more receivers are used what is
10:52	the difference between two positioning
10:54	methods point positioning and
10:56	differential or relative positioning
10:59	point positioning involves determining
11:01	the position of a single point by
11:03	tracking a minimum number of satellites
11:05	usually with one GPS receiver while this
11:09	method takes full advantage of the GPS
11:11	technological capabilities it still has
11:13	some drawbacks these drawbacks are
11:16	significant with one receiver you are
11:19	usually unable to resolve errors in the
11:21	satellite clock the satellite ephemeris
11:24	or its orbital parameters and the
11:26	atmosphere primarily the ionosphere we
11:29	can remove or greatly reduce the effect
11:31	of these errors through a technique
11:33	called differential or relative
11:35	positioning this is accomplished by
11:38	deploying one in preferably two
11:40	receivers two stations with known
11:42	geodetic or state plane coordinates in
11:45	California it would seem advisable to
11:46	use the station's established during the
11:49	high precision geodetic network for this
11:50	purpose however any pair of stations
11:53	whose coordinates have been determined
11:55	to a suitable level of accuracy
11:57	depending upon project requirements
11:59	could be used the remaining receivers
12:01	would be placed over survey points for
12:03	which coordinates are to be determined
12:05	if the survey area is not overly large
12:08	say for example 60 kilometers on the
12:10	side we can eliminate most of the errors
12:13	associated with point positioning we
12:15	eliminate the effects of distortion of
12:17	the signal as it travels through the
12:18	ionosphere since the signals travel
12:20	through the same ionosphere and route to
12:22	all deployed receivers similarly the
12:25	error in the satellites ephemeris that
12:27	is the position of the satellite in
12:28	space and the satellites clocks can
12:31	likewise be eliminated since these
12:32	errors are the same for all receivers in
12:35	effect since we know the absolute
12:37	position of our known static station we
12:39	can determine the errors and eliminate
12:41	them from the receiver deployed at the
12:43	unknown station or stations in a
12:46	relative sense these errors can be
12:47	eliminated if we occupied only stations
12:49	for which there were no known
12:51	coordinates such a survey would not be
12:53	related to any network or data but by
12:55	initiating a survey over two known
12:57	points such as the HPG n which has
13:00	California coordinate system coordinates
13:02	we obtain equally accurate coordinates
13:05	for the new points an analogy could be
13:07	made to a ground-based Traverse in the
13:09	former case we could perform a traverse
13:11	based on project coordinates it is a
13:13	precise Traverse but you cannot relate
13:16	it to say the California coordinate
13:17	system in the latter case if we begin
13:20	the Traverse on a point of known CCS
13:22	coordinates and ended on another point
13:24	of known CCS coordinates we know the
13:27	relationship of all of the Traverse
13:28	points to some common datum and can
13:30	provide accurate CCS coordinates for all
13:33	of the stations in the Traverse in
13:35	effect differential positioning is the
13:37	key to virtually all survey applications
13:39	of the GPS technology notice the
13:42	emphasis on survey we have not touched
13:45	on one other error associated with GPS
13:48	tracking operations this is the receiver
13:51	clock error which is different for each
13:52	receiver each receiver is equipped with
13:55	an internal clock and the ability to
13:57	compute positions based on the data it
13:59	receives from the satellites in simple
14:02	terms the receiver attempts to compute a
14:04	position based on a series of range
14:06	measurements from the satellites
14:08	this is done by multiplying the time the
14:10	signal takes to travel from the
14:11	satellite to the receiver at the speed
14:13	of light receiver clock errors can cause
14:16	the individual range measurements to
14:18	diverge from a point position the
14:21	receiver computer applies a correction
14:23	to allow for a best fit solution this
14:26	correction is the individual receiver
14:28	clock error there is one other current
14:31	source of error it is potentially the
14:33	worst source and is derived from a
14:35	process called selective availability or
14:37	si si usually refers to the process of
14:41	deliberately falsifying the time a
14:43	signal is broadcast by the satellites
14:45	another term for this is clock dither
14:47	with Si employed the accuracy of a
14:50	position may be no better than 100
14:52	meters versus 30 meters without Si in
14:55	real-time positioning mode this problem
14:59	is more severe in the navigation mode
15:00	but it can be effectively eliminated in
15:03	the survey differential Operations mode
15:05	since si is intended to interfere with
15:08	real-time operations most GPS surveys do
15:11	not require position determination in
15:13	real-time and the use of the
15:16	differential positioning technique helps
15:18	also to eliminate the errors introduced
15:19	by Si these errors are the same for all
15:22	receivers in the same manner that
15:24	satellite ephemeris and clock errors and
15:26	ionosphere errors are the same for all
15:28	receivers and can thus be removed there
15:32	is another source of concern with GPS
15:34	positioning it is anti-spoofing
15:36	anti-spoofing will further degrade the
15:38	satellite signals so as to make them
15:40	potentially unusable some receiver
15:43	manufacturers believe they will have a
15:45	way around this problem in the near
15:46	future but the GPS satellite
15:49	constellation is controlled by the US
15:51	Department of Defense and they are the
15:53	ultimate authority on whether
15:54	anti-spoofing will be employed there is
15:57	ongoing discussion among the GPS user
15:59	community in an attempt to deter the
16:01	Department of Defense from implementing
16:03	anti-spoofing in any event it is not
16:06	scheduled to be implemented until the
16:07	full 24 satellite constellation is in
16:10	place about early 1994 at the present
16:16	time there are three basic tracking
16:17	methodologies these are static kinematic
16:21	and
16:21	pseudo kinematic or pseudo static these
16:24	are in more or less general use software
16:27	has been well tested and accuracy
16:29	results verified there are two more
16:31	methodologies currently in the spring of
16:33	1992 under development these are
16:36	referred to as rapid static or fast
16:38	ambiguity resolution and GPS controlled
16:41	photogrammetry these right or two will
16:44	be also discussed if only briefly
16:46	towards the end of the presentation they
16:48	have been demonstrated but there are
16:50	probably more tests to be run before
16:51	they are placed in a routine production
16:53	mode there are several receiver
16:56	manufacturers and some of these are
16:58	investigating these newer uses of the
16:59	technology some will get there sooner
17:01	than others it is for this reason that I
17:04	feel we are a year or so away from being
17:06	able to have all receiver software
17:08	packages provide the necessary
17:09	reliability for these newer
17:11	methodologies before going further I
17:14	would like to touch on the accuracy
17:16	potential of GPS when tests were run
17:19	with GPS it became apparent that the
17:22	technology was capable of achieving
17:23	accuracies greater than that of existing
17:26	terrestrial survey methodologies that is
17:29	triangulation trilateration and Traverse
17:31	I assume that you were familiar with the
17:34	terminology used to describe survey
17:36	accuracies that is 1st 2nd and 3rd order
17:38	but GPS has demonstrated its capability
17:41	to significantly exceed these accuracies
17:44	for this reason three new categories of
17:47	accuracies were developed an increasing
17:50	accuracy these are order B the next
17:53	level above first order order a and
17:55	order EE as you can see the order B
17:59	accuracy level is nominally one part per
18:01	million of the line length between
18:03	adjacent stations the letter designation
18:06	was used to ensure that the continued
18:08	usage of the terminology of first second
18:10	and third order was preserved statewide
18:13	high precision networks have been
18:15	designated and surveyed to order B
18:17	accuracy order a level accuracy zat one
18:22	part per 10 million are used to control
18:25	these high order statewide networks
18:27	there may ultimately be about 200 such
18:29	stations in the United States this will
18:32	be the primary reference frame for the
18:34	country
18:35	or double-a stations are used almost
18:37	exclusively for geodynamic concerns
18:39	those dealing with issues related to
18:41	crustal motions or plate tectonics on an
18:44	international scale
18:45	one thing you should notice is that the
18:47	GPS satellite system has some base error
18:49	associated with it at the order double-a
18:52	level it is only three millimeters at
18:55	the orderby level this increases to
18:56	eight millimeters these accuracies are
19:01	defined and explained in the federal
19:02	geodetic control committee publication
19:04	geometric geometric and geodetic
19:06	accuracy standards and specifications
19:08	for using GPS relative positioning
19:11	techniques version 5 may 11 1988
19:14	reprinted with Corrections August 1 1989
19:17	the publication is intended only as a
19:20	guideline because of the rapidly
19:21	changing nature of GPS surveying I will
19:26	be discussing the California
19:27	high-precision geodetic network later in
19:29	the presentation this survey was
19:31	performed using relative positioning
19:33	techniques and was done to F GCC order B
19:36	accuracy and specifications it was
19:39	further related to the widely spaced
19:41	national order a network now that we
19:45	have some feel for the different levels
19:46	of accuracy we will move to GPS survey
19:49	procedures remember that all of our
19:51	discussion about GPS surveying refers to
19:53	the differential positioning technique
19:56	irrespective of the methodology being
19:58	employed for example static or kinematic
20:01	there are issues which are common to the
20:03	methodologies these include satellite
20:05	elevation cutoff satellite configuration
20:08	the minimum number of satellites the
20:10	tracking epoch and station site
20:12	selection to name them more important
20:14	current procedures call for tracking of
20:17	all satellites until they fall below the
20:19	limit of 15 degrees above the horizon as
20:22	satellites fall below this limit the
20:24	signals they transmit have to travel
20:26	through more of the ionosphere and the
20:28	troposphere the near Earth atmosphere
20:30	there is the potential for introducing
20:32	more error here or unduly increasing the
20:35	amount of time on data reduction if we
20:37	track the low this elevation thus most
20:40	survey applications place the 15 degree
20:42	limit on tracking another issue related
20:45	to GPS positioning is the tracking epoch
20:48	or how frequently rerecord satellite
20:51	information
20:52	static applications usually track data
20:55	on a 15 second interval kinematic
20:58	applications might require a one-second
21:00	interval most receivers allow you to set
21:02	this time interval or epoch there are
21:05	several other related issues first and
21:07	most obvious is the need to select a
21:09	prospective survey station either
21:11	existing or new which has no
21:13	obstructions above 15 degrees in some
21:16	areas this may be relatively simple but
21:19	in other areas some judicious site
21:20	selection may be necessary the second
21:23	issue is the number of satellites to be
21:25	tracked for satellites force excuse me
21:28	for a static positioning a minimum of
21:31	four satellites are required for most of
21:33	the other methods five and maybe six
21:35	satellites will be required
21:37	another issue is related to the function
21:40	called geometric dilution of precision
21:41	or g-dub
21:43	there are several dilution of precision
21:45	factors but we will only deal with g-dub
21:47	this is basically a measure of the level
21:50	of accuracy we can expect from tracking
21:52	a series of GPS satellites over a given
21:55	period of time the debt of the
21:57	satellites are distributed in the sky
21:59	the higher the achievable accuracy you
22:02	might consider this issue as similar to
22:03	a survey intersection problem if you are
22:06	attempting to position a new station
22:07	from a series of four known stations
22:09	spaced 90 degrees around the horizon you
22:12	would expect to have a more accurate
22:14	position for the new station if on the
22:17	other hand you attempted to position the
22:19	unknown station from four stations
22:21	clustered in a band covering about 45
22:23	degrees in asmath you would expect a
22:25	somewhat weaker solution
22:27	if you were to sign numeric values to
22:30	the level of accuracy for these two
22:31	examples the lower the number the
22:33	greater the expected accuracy you would
22:36	have an analogous situation with the G
22:38	dot determination our first example here
22:40	shows a case of poor jadhav the
22:42	satellites are clustered in a very
22:44	narrow area this will significantly bias
22:46	the resulting position in this example
22:51	we see that three of the satellites are
22:53	distributed evenly around the horizon
22:55	with the fourth satellite almost
22:56	directly overhead this provides for a
22:59	very accurate solution position
23:01	but we must remember that the satellites
23:03	are not stationary in space as the
23:06	satellites change position with respect
23:07	to the GPS receiver antenna position the
23:11	G dot value changes constantly during
23:15	the course of observations it is
23:16	possible that the G dot value may change
23:18	significantly this usually occurs only
23:21	for very brief periods of time during a
23:23	selected observing session G da is a
23:26	measure of the geometric strength of the
23:27	satellite configuration reduced to a
23:30	numeric value for all precise surveys a
23:32	G dot figure of 6.0 or less as usual and
23:36	you can probably see how having more
23:39	than four satellites in view increases
23:41	the potential for a better G
23:43	determination most if not all GPS
23:46	receiver manufacturers provide software
23:48	which allows you to determine the G dot
23:50	automatically the G dot factor will
23:53	probably play a less important role when
23:55	the full constellation of satellites is
23:57	in orbit this is because the design of
24:00	the full 24 satellite constellation is
24:02	such that there will always be four
24:04	satellites and in view and in such a
24:06	configuration that the G dot will
24:08	normally be suitable for virtually all
24:10	survey applications the full
24:13	constellation will probably not be in
24:14	place until early 1994 what do we do in
24:18	the interim we simply pay much closer
24:20	attention to the predicted satellite
24:22	orbital information this information is
24:24	also available through equipment
24:26	manufacturer software there are two
24:28	basic steps the first is to review a
24:31	24-hour table of predictions for the
24:33	existing constellation here we see a
24:36	simplified view of the satellite
24:37	availability for a 24-hour period on
24:40	some given day from about 0 800 to 1400
24:44	California Daylight Time there are 4
24:46	satellites available note that satellite
24:49	six drops out of the field of view or
24:51	more precisely it drops below the 15
24:53	degree elevation limit we have imposed
24:55	but at about the same time that
24:58	satellite six drops below this limit
25:00	satellite 21 rises above this limit thus
25:03	we could track continuously until about
25:05	2400 when both satellites 11 and 16 fall
25:09	below this limit and we are reduced to
25:11	fewer than four satellites
25:13	the second step is to relate the G
25:16	values against this table of predictions
25:18	we would then determine the time periods
25:20	when it would be suitable to perform
25:22	tracking operations that is those times
25:24	on a minimum of four satellites or five
25:26	for kinematic are available and when the
25:29	G values are below the desired maximum
25:31	say six point zero for purposes of this
25:34	presentation we will assume that the
25:36	four satellite period met this G dot
25:38	criterion
25:39	like many survey operations there are
25:42	often ways around a given problem the
25:44	same case can be made for GPS surveys
25:46	but sometimes the solution to one
25:49	problem gives rise to another let us
25:52	suppose we need to use GPS to survey an
25:54	area which is not free of obstructions
25:56	above our normal 15 degree cutoff a
25:59	careful review of the satellite orbital
26:01	information might reveal that the
26:03	obstructions do not block those parts of
26:05	the satellite orbit in which we are
26:06	interested maybe we can delay the
26:09	beginning of GPS tracking until the
26:11	satellite rises above the obstruction
26:12	these are suitable alternatives and may
26:15	enable you to resolve an apparently
26:16	improbable situation but you should
26:19	ensure that these obstructions do not
26:21	introduce something called multipath
26:23	multipath occurs when the receiver
26:25	obtains a signal directly from the
26:27	satellite and the same signal bounces
26:29	off some nearby obstruction the receiver
26:32	is thus receiving the same signal at two
26:34	different times or vying to to provide
26:37	two different paths multipath can be
26:40	caused by nearby mountains fences signs
26:42	buildings and other similar objects
26:45	above the level of the antenna careful
26:47	site selection can help to eliminate
26:49	this problem some multipath problems can
26:52	be resolved in the data reduction but it
26:54	is usually a time-consuming process with
26:57	this basic understanding of what we need
26:59	to consider when performing GPS tracking
27:01	measurements we can now move on to some
27:03	discussion of the different
27:04	methodologies static positioning was the
27:09	first method to be used for satellite
27:10	positioning one could make the case that
27:12	the other methods or variations on this
27:14	theme as the name implies static
27:17	positioning requires that a receiver be
27:19	set up on a control point or a new
27:21	survey point for some set period of time
27:23	say in excess of one hour as a general
27:26	rule of thumb
27:27	the higher the level of accuracy
27:29	required the longer you remain on
27:31	station and the example you will see on
27:34	the screen in just a moment I have
27:35	chosen a seven station network which
27:37	will be reserved which we will be
27:39	observing with three receivers and I am
27:41	planning to obtain first order accuracy
27:43	x' as defined and the previously
27:45	mentioned F GCC guidelines in static
27:48	positioning for satellites should be
27:50	available for the duration of the
27:52	observing window our limited time for
27:54	this presentation will not allow me to
27:56	fully develop this next point I would
27:58	refer you to the FTC C guidelines given
28:01	this seven station project and three
28:04	receivers
28:04	several levels of accuracy are possible
28:07	the results depend on the number of
28:09	observation sessions and the number of
28:11	redundant station occupations these
28:14	additional sessions increase the number
28:16	of times individual stations are
28:17	observed this is one of the critical
28:19	issues when designing a project to meet
28:22	some prescribed level of accuracy
28:24	referring to the level the layout of the
28:26	seven stations I have indicated the
28:28	potential accuracies with the number of
28:30	sessions for example in the first
28:33	scenario of only three sessions only two
28:35	stations are occupied more than once
28:37	there is only limited redundancy
28:39	according to the F G C C guidelines this
28:42	survey would not meet any accuracy level
28:44	you may recall something I mentioned in
28:47	the introduction it is possible to miss
28:49	apply the GPS technology here is just
28:52	such a case reviewing the next scenario
28:55	we see that as the number of sessions
28:57	and station occupations increase the
28:59	accuracy increases also in scenario two
29:02	we see that the number of sessions has
29:04	been increased by one this scenario will
29:06	provide for second-order class two level
29:09	of accuracy this is still short of our
29:11	stated accuracy requirement the first
29:13	order by adding one more session in the
29:16	third scenario we have met the
29:18	prescribed accuracy level in this
29:20	scenario only one station was occupied
29:22	less than two times six stations were
29:25	occupied at least twice and two of these
29:27	stations were occupied three times this
29:30	is a compilation of the foregoing
29:32	discussion I have included yet another
29:34	session to indicate how we could further
29:36	upgrade the network to an even higher
29:37	order of accuracy
29:38	we will come back to this in our
29:40	discussion of project planning I hope
29:43	you can begin to see that there is a
29:44	certain level of planning which goes
29:46	into ensuring that the FG CC guidelines
29:49	are met let us now assume that we are
29:52	performing a survey where higher orders
29:53	of accuracy are not required say order B
29:56	and where the surveying is is being
29:58	accomplished over a limited area this
30:01	provides us with other methodologies we
30:03	may wish to consider these are kinematic
30:05	and pseudo kinematic GPS surveys as the
30:08	name kinematic implies one or more of
30:11	our receivers will be placed on a moving
30:12	platform say an automobile or a train
30:15	the methodology is even being used for
30:17	GPS control of photogrammetry pseudo
30:20	kinematic is a variation on both the
30:22	static and kinematic methods kinematic
30:26	surveys involve the use of a base
30:28	receiver at a known location and at
30:30	least one Rover receiver
30:31	since kinematic surveys involve moving
30:34	receivers we need to track or sample the
30:36	data more frequently than in static
30:38	surveys many static surveys are
30:41	performed in 15 second increments or
30:43	epochs and most kinematic surveys are
30:46	performed in one second increments a
30:48	kinematic survey can be started in any
30:50	of three ways the Rover antenna can be
30:53	placed over a second existing control
30:55	point for which coordinates are known to
30:57	the same level of accuracy as the base
30:59	station the Rover antenna can be placed
31:02	over an unknown point and tracking can
31:04	be done on the static mode and the
31:06	receiver then switches to the kinematic
31:08	mode or the Rover antenna can be swapped
31:11	with the base station antenna in the
31:14	case where there are two known stations
31:16	the rover receiver would sit at the
31:18	second station for a matter of a few
31:19	minutes and begin the kinematic survey
31:21	in the case where there is not a second
31:24	control point available there are two
31:25	basic alternatives the first is to
31:27	determine coordinates for the second
31:29	point by tracking in the second in the
31:31	static mode for a period of an hour or
31:33	longer after this period we would switch
31:36	the receiver to the kinematic mode a
31:38	second alternative is to perform an
31:40	antenna swap in this process two
31:43	receivers and antennas are set up in
31:44	close proximity to each other after a
31:47	brief observing time the two antennas
31:49	are moved to the other receiver station
31:51	or swapped
31:52	in this method both receivers are
31:54	effectively tracking over the known
31:55	station but at different times after
31:58	another brief tracking time the antennas
32:00	are returned or swapped to their
32:02	original station and the kinematic
32:04	survey is begun it is imperative that
32:07	during the antenna swap the receivers do
32:09	not lose LOC on any of the satellites
32:11	any of these alternatives resolves the
32:14	phase ambiguity between the two
32:15	receivers after any of the foregoing
32:18	have been accomplished the roving
32:20	receiver is transported along some
32:22	predefined route it stops at selected
32:24	stations and route for a minute or so
32:26	before returning to the original known
32:28	station during the entire survey we must
32:31	maintain lock to all satellites as we
32:34	will see with pseudo kinematic a second
32:36	second independent or redundant set of
32:39	measurements at the same stations will
32:41	be required on a second day or later the
32:43	same day so long as sufficient time has
32:45	elapsed between the two sets of
32:47	observations a second rover receiver
32:50	could also be employed it would be used
32:52	in exactly the same manner as the first
32:54	but it might start at survey about an
32:56	hour later this is another planning
32:59	issue if we have only two receivers the
33:01	choice is obvious if we have three
33:03	receivers we might deploy all three to
33:06	the project and finish it in a shorter
33:07	time frame but with four receivers we
33:10	have an option to perform two separate
33:12	surveys simultaneously the purpose of
33:15	the antenna swap the static
33:16	determination of the second point are
33:18	using a known second point is to resolve
33:21	any phase ambiguities between the two
33:23	receivers in simple terms this means
33:25	that we want to be certain that both
33:27	receivers begin the kinematic portion of
33:29	the survey with the correct number of
33:31	integer cycles for their respective
33:32	receivers without going through this
33:35	initialization process we could be tech
33:37	collecting potentially erroneous data
33:39	making the survey worthless in many
33:42	respects the kinematic methodology
33:44	offers significant improvement in
33:45	productivity since it requires
33:47	continuous lock to a minimum of four and
33:50	more appropriately five satellites it
33:52	has some drawbacks it cannot be used in
33:55	some urban environments where the moving
33:57	platform the vehicle goes between
33:59	buildings or through under pastures even
34:01	an instantaneous loss of satellite
34:03	signal referred to as the loss of
34:05	could render the survey useless and
34:08	kinematic surveys are generally used
34:10	over relatively small areas let us
34:13	suppose that we are not concerned with
34:15	the actual track of the vehicle but we
34:17	wish only to position selected points in
34:19	a given project area we might then
34:21	consider using a slightly different
34:23	methodology pseudo kinematic surveying
34:26	the methodology of pseudo kinematic
34:28	survey is similar in some respect to
34:30	both static and kinematic it is similar
34:33	to static in that we spend more time say
34:35	ten minutes at the individual stations
34:38	which make up our network down the 1
34:40	minute or so recommended for kinematic
34:41	and we process the data similar to the
34:44	static method
34:45	unlike kinematic though we do not need
34:47	to maintain lock on the minimum a
34:49	minimum number of satellites throughout
34:51	the survey we are not interested in what
34:53	route have we travelled to get to our
34:55	stations therefore this data is not
34:57	required we do acquire lock on the
34:59	satellite say after we have arrived at
35:01	each specific station in our network
35:03	pseudo kinematic surveys also require a
35:06	base or monitor station receiver similar
35:09	to kinematic in pseudo kinematic surveys
35:11	like kinematic surveys we would visit
35:13	each station in the second time at least
35:16	an hour after the first visit this
35:18	allows sufficient time for the satellite
35:19	configuration to change enough to give
35:22	an independent solution or the scenario
35:24	could be run a second time on the next
35:26	day either of these provides the
35:28	redundancy we are so particular about in
35:30	GPS surveying the federal geodetic
35:34	control committee has not yet published
35:35	guidelines for kinematic and pseudo
35:37	kinematic surveys
35:38	however these methodologies are in more
35:41	or less general use and have been
35:42	accepted exercise caution when
35:45	considering these methods they are not
35:47	suitable for large scale projects at
35:49	least at this time this is true in part
35:51	because the larger the area the more
35:53	likely you are to encounter obstructions
35:55	in addition both of these methods
35:57	recommend the use of the same satellites
35:59	at the base and mobile receivers as you
36:02	move farther away from the base station
36:03	the greater is the likelihood that there
36:05	will be fewer than the minimum number of
36:07	common satellites even though there are
36:10	obvious advantages to be gained with
36:11	certain methodologies there are equally
36:13	good reasons why they might not work in
36:15	particular projects at the end of the
36:17	presentation I will discuss
36:19	newer method which offers some relief
36:20	from the issue of maintaining continuous
36:22	law in kinematic surveys
36:30	this leads logically into the issue of
36:32	planning a GPS survey the first step is
36:36	to attempt to define the absolute
36:37	accuracy requirements for a project this
36:40	is not always easy but assuming that a
36:42	surveying entity is able to determine
36:44	the level of accuracy then it is wise to
36:47	lay the project out on a suitable map
36:49	then determine the station spacing
36:51	requirements with the project area and
36:54	station spacing you will then have an
36:56	idea of the total number of stations
36:58	required for the project you will also
37:00	have a feel for what methodology or
37:02	combination of methodologies you should
37:04	employ on the project you should include
37:07	at least two existing stations in the
37:08	project whose coordinates are known to
37:11	at least the level of accuracy
37:12	requirements of the project again I
37:15	would strongly suggest you consider
37:16	using stations established as part of
37:18	the Caltrans sponsored high precision
37:20	geodetic network as the basis for
37:22	control for GPS projects in my earlier
37:25	example I discussed how increased
37:27	accuracy requirements can be met by
37:29	adding the proper additional observing
37:31	sessions but I think you can see that
37:33	one alternative we did not cover was
37:35	adding additional receivers adding a
37:37	fourth or fifth receiver would
37:39	necessitate fewer sessions but the
37:41	additional receivers require additional
37:43	observing personnel vehicles and other
37:45	related equipment so you might need to
37:47	look at a few different ways to observe
37:49	each project there is probably no right
37:52	way to plan a project each will be
37:54	accomplished according to the resources
37:55	which can be allocated to it it is
37:58	important to remember that whatever the
38:00	number of receivers there are still
38:01	basic requirements which must be met in
38:03	order to achieve the stated level of
38:05	accuracy the key here is redundancy
38:08	consider a project requiring first order
38:11	accuracy that is 10 millimeters plus 1
38:13	part the 100 thousand 10 percent of the
38:17	total number of stations must be
38:18	occupied three times 25 percent of
38:21	existing control stations and 30 percent
38:24	of all new stations must be occupied
38:25	twice California HPG n stations are the
38:29	logical choice to be used for the basic
38:31	control for this project
38:32	the HPG end coordinates are at an order
38:35	of magnitude higher or 2b than the first
38:38	order required for this project if there
38:41	are only two existing control stations
38:43	in the project it is advisable to occupy
38:45	both of them on two separate occasions
38:47	since your redundancy is otherwise
38:49	limited the F GCC guidelines provide a
38:52	rather quick method of determining the
38:54	total number of observing sessions for a
38:56	given project with any specific number
38:58	of receivers it takes into account
39:00	redundancy requirements how many
39:03	sessions can be accomplished in a
39:04	particular day and safety and production
39:07	factors these the last two factors are
39:09	your estimate of the reliability of the
39:11	equipment and logistic concerns first
39:14	order GPS observation usually require a
39:17	minimum of 90 minutes of tracking time
39:19	up to this point we have not discussed
39:22	the length of the observing session a
39:23	review of the satellite availability
39:26	which we used earlier indicates an
39:28	observing window of six hours from zero
39:30	300 to 1400 if we were confident in the
39:34	ability of our receiver operators we
39:36	might want to consider three sessions
39:37	per day we might for example track three
39:40	30-minute sessions from zero 800 to zero
39:43
3:30
39:44	from 10:15 to 11:45 and from 12:30 to
39:48	3400 this would allow 45 minutes for the
39:52	receiver operator to complete
39:53	observations at one station drive to the
39:56	next station and begin observations at
39:58	the next station we need to determine if
40:00	this is reasonable for if sessions are
40:03	kept to their absolute minimum
40:04	how does a 15-minute delay and starting
40:06	by one receiver operator affect the
40:08	overall session integrity if minimizing
40:11	the tracking times could adversely
40:13	affect our progress then maybe we should
40:15	only schedule two sessions per day we
40:18	might want to consider extending each
40:20	operation to 120 minutes we would have
40:23	sufficient redundancy with the longer
40:24	tracking time some minimal loss of
40:27	tracking time at a station might not be
40:28	a problem and we can also allow for more
40:31	travel time between stations and perhaps
40:33	more importantly we might preclude some
40:35	problems which might arise due to hasty
40:37	operations on the other hand if we are
40:40	considering kinematic or pseudo
40:41	kinematic operations for this particular
40:43	project we immediately note that we do
40:46	not have
40:46	the required five satellite minimum
40:48	availability with the full constellation
40:51	availability in 1994 we will probably
40:54	have more options to consider when you
40:57	factor in what projects you have to
40:58	accomplish and how many resources you
41:01	can allocate to each of them you have a
41:03	means to determine how best to
41:04	accomplish each project you might find
41:07	for example that leasing an additional
41:09	receiver is more productive than
41:10	operating one extra day without that
41:12	receiver so even after you have done
41:14	your basic planning of the number
41:16	spacing and accuracy of the stations in
41:19	a project there is still some
41:20	flexibility in how the project is
41:22	ultimately scheduled I want to emphasize
41:24	again that planning is the key to
41:26	conducting good GPS surveys to this
41:30	point we have extolled the virtues of
41:31	the GPS technology because of the
41:33	revolutionary changes it brings to
41:35	serving the ability to provide highly
41:37	accurate horizontal coordinates in a
41:39	much shorter period of time and with
41:41	significantly reduced expenditure of
41:42	resources is remarkable however the same
41:46	level of accuracy cannot yet be achieved
41:48	in the vertical component this is a
41:50	rather complex issue although it arises
41:52	from a seemingly simple process
41:54	conventional leveling either spirit
41:57	leveling or trigonometric leveling
41:58	provides elevations refer to the geoid
42:00	and thus to the physical surface of the
42:02	earth GPS measurements are related to a
42:06	reference ellipsoid not the goe
42:07	or the physical surface of the earth so
42:10	we must find a way to determine GPS
42:12	derived ortho metric Heights one method
42:15	of accomplishing this is to have a
42:16	suitable number of vertical control
42:18	monuments or benchmarks in the vicinity
42:20	of the project it might then be possible
42:22	to determine the geoid height if we have
42:25	both GPS and leveling data at these
42:27	benchmarks this might assume that we can
42:30	interpolate the GPS excuse-me
42:32	interpolate the geoid at other GPS
42:34	points where levelling data is not
42:36	available we might only be able to make
42:39	this assumption in relatively flat
42:40	terrain there is currently available
42:42	what is now the most accurate geoid
42:44	model for the United States it is called
42:47	geoid 90 it was determined by combining
42:49	all available gravity data and relating
42:51	it to leveling data applying this method
42:54	and this model to our project should
42:56	improve our determination of the geoid
42:58	however it is still not accurate enough
43:01	to equate horizontal accuracies of say 1
43:03	to 2 centimeters between adjacent
43:05	stations to that same level of accuracy
43:07	in the vertical component this is due to
43:10	the uncertainty in the random error and
43:12	the vertical component of the GPS data
43:15	probably caused by tropospheric and
43:17	ionospheric refraction at the present
43:20	time vertical elevations can probably be
43:22	determined no better than 3 to 5
43:24	centimeters in the best case we can
43:29	probably expect to improve this somewhat
43:31	when the full constellation of
43:32	satellites is deployed and better
43:34	three-dimensional coverage is available
43:36	we might also expect to see some
43:38	improvement when tracking the stronger P
43:40	code signals perhaps down to the 10
43:43	degree level and maybe even to 5 degrees
43:44	above the horizon to complicate this
43:47	issue GPS is being used to determine
43:50	ground some sightings and uplift GPS
43:53	provides a precise measure of vertical
43:55	control the key word here is precise we
43:57	can determine in a height with a
43:59	sufficient amount of GPS data we can
44:01	then return to the same stations a year
44:03	or more later and note whether these
44:05	same stations have remained stable or if
44:07	they have undergone some vertical
44:09	movement we can determine this vertical
44:11	movement in a relative sense very
44:13	accurately but we cannot prescribe
44:15	actual accurate elevations at present
44:18	you should just remember that vertical
44:20	control elevations cannot be obtained as
44:22	accurately as Kent horizontal control
44:24	coordinates for example second-order
44:27	Class two leveling over a 16 kilometer
44:29	line has a maximum allowable error of 6
44:32	millimetres times the square root of the
44:34	distance or 24 millimetres thus GPS over
44:37	the same distance cannot equal this
44:39	accuracy even under the best of
44:41	circumstances I have made several
44:43	references to the California high
44:45	precision geodetic network the HPG n I
44:48	would like to explain just what the H PG
44:50	n is and why I am recommending its use
44:52	the h PG n is a statewide GPS project
44:56	sponsored and funded by Caltrans in
44:58	conjunction with the National geodetic
44:59	survey the project consists of some 244
45:03	stations
45:04	spaced more or less equally throughout
45:06	California station spacing is about 40
45:09	miles or 60 kilometres about 200
45:12	stations are on major highway routes and
45:14	less readily accessible to the surveying
45:16	community the stations were established
45:18	in 1991 and all GPS observations were
45:21	completed in August of that year the
45:24	project was accomplished to meet GPS or
45:26	to be accuracy awareness for the network
45:29	are available as of about May 1992 the
45:33	project was accomplished to provide a
45:34	single unified and highly accurate
45:37	network of geodetic control throughout
45:39	California in addition the network is
45:42	part of the National geodetic reference
45:43	system has established and maintained by
45:46	the National geodetic survey the project
45:49	is not unique to California but is
45:51	national in scope and accurately related
45:54	to high order networks established in
45:56	other states similar networks have been
45:59	established in the neighboring states of
46:00	Oregon and Arizona as well as in about
46:04	twenty other states with a completed and
46:07	adjusted H PG n in place the surveying
46:09	community in California will have a
46:11	network to which all future surveys can
46:13	be related it is not necessary that
46:16	future stations be established to this
46:18	order be level of accuracy but if the
46:20	network becomes the framework to which
46:22	future projects are related then we can
46:24	assume an accurate interrelationship
46:26	among any of a variety of GPS surveys
46:28	performed in the state of California the
46:31	station spacing for the network was
46:33	determined so that follow on or
46:35	densification projects could be
46:36	completed to at least first order using
46:39	no more than single frequency GPS
46:41	receivers the network was designed to
46:43	accommodate GPS surveys
46:45	however azimuth marks were not set nor
46:48	were stations set to as to be inter
46:50	visible a rather difficult criterion to
46:52	meet anyway because of the station
46:53	spacing Caltrans plans to monitor the
46:57	network on an annual basis stations are
46:59	in need of minor maintenance this will
47:00	be performed by the respective Caltrans
47:03	district if a station has been destroyed
47:05	or is in danger of being destroyed
47:07	Caltrans will establish a new station in
47:10	the same general vicinity as the law
47:11	station additional observations will be
47:14	made to the same criteria as when the
47:16	station was originally established this
47:18	will maintain the ongoing accuracy and
47:20	integrity of the HPG the coordinates of
47:24	the network will be published relative
47:25	to the North America
47:26	datum of 1983 or nad83 the values will
47:30	be listed as nad83 1990 1.35 this means
47:36	that there will be no datum change but
47:38	that the stations will would be referred
47:40	to the 1990 1.35 epoch this corresponds
47:44	to the midpoint of the five month field
47:46	campaign to obtain the HPG n gps
47:50	coordinates you may wonder how this
47:52	relates to the nad 83 coordinates which
47:54	have been in use for the past six or so
47:56	years the nad 83 readjustment was
47:59	published in 1986 thus these coordinates
48:02	are more appropriately nad 83
48:04	parentheses 1986 as I mentioned earlier
48:08	the HPG n is related to about 20 crustal
48:11	motion or other order 8 stations these
48:14	stations are not exactly stationary with
48:16	respect to one another because of
48:17	crustal motions it was necessary to
48:20	determine their interrelationship at the
48:22	epoch of the HPG n project this is
48:25	especially necessary in California
48:26	because California is on two distinctive
48:29	tectonic plates the North American plate
48:31	and the Pacific plate the line of
48:34	separation is basically the San Andreas
48:36	Fault crustal motions of as much as
48:39	about 4 centimeters per year have been
48:41	documented along the fault if we were to
48:44	hold nad 83 1986 epic stations fixed we
48:48	would have had motions in excess of 20
48:50	centimeters in the intervening six years
48:52	this level of error is intolerable in
48:54	gps surveys which are capable of so much
48:57	more accuracy I should note that where
49:00	necessary these several centimeter
49:01	annual movements may need to be
49:03	considered in future surveys to this end
49:06	the National geodetic survey will be
49:08	publishing velocity vectors for the
49:10	coordinates of stations on the Pacific
49:11	plate and in other areas where
49:13	appreciable crustal motion is known when
49:16	comparing vectors between adjacent HPG
49:19	and stations at some future time these
49:21	velocity vectors should be applied to
49:23	the nad 81 1990 1.35 epoch vectors for
49:28	many survey applications perhaps
49:30	something as small as a few centimeter
49:31	movement per year may not be significant
49:34	but large-scale construction projects
49:36	and custom motion surveys for earthquake
49:38	hazard reduction will
49:40	to take these motions into account at
49:44	this time there are two significant
49:45	developments in GPS positioning
49:47	methodologies the first goes by a set of
49:49	different names apparently depending on
49:51	the Equipment Manufacturer current names
49:54	for this methodology a rapid static fast
49:57	static or fast ambiguity resolution all
50:00	GPS measurements are founded on the
50:02	ability to determine the number of whole
50:04	wavelengths between the satellite and
50:06	the receiver as the term implies this
50:09	rapid or fast method is similar to the
50:11	static method except it is accomplished
50:13	in a much shorter period of time this is
50:15	because we are able to rapidly determine
50:17	the uncertainty or ambiguity in the
50:20	number of full wavelengths received from
50:21	the satellites thus the more technical
50:23	term fast ambiguity resolution to put
50:27	this in perspective a normal static
50:29	occupation to provide control at the
50:30	first order level nominally one part in
50:33	500,000 might require a minimum of 90
50:36	minutes of tracking at individual sites
50:38	in general dual frequency receivers of
50:41	either the C a code or P code variety
50:43	can be expected to reduce this to a
50:45	maximum of about 5 minutes using fast
50:48	ambiguity the significance of this
50:50	methodology is that it does not require
50:52	you to maintain LOC and any satellites
50:54	as you move from one station to the
50:55	other if it is determined that we have
50:58	to visit stations twice as in the pseudo
51:00	kinematic mode we can still realize some
51:02	significant savings employed in this
51:04	method present tests seem to indicate
51:06	that this method is suitable for
51:08	small-scale projects with line lengths
51:10	between stations of maybe no more than
51:12	two kilometers although some proponents
51:14	say this could be extended to about 10
51:16	kilometers if we apply this method to
51:18	our earlier 7 station project we could
51:21	be done with the project in perhaps less
51:23	than half a day from a Productivity
51:25	standpoint there should be a remarkable
51:27	use of the technology but as I indicated
51:29	in the opening of the presentation I
51:31	believe we are still a year or so away
51:33	from using this method in a truly
51:34	operational mode the other significant
51:38	use of the technology is using GPS to
51:40	control photogrammetry several tests and
51:43	production projects of this methodology
51:44	have been completed in effect a GPS
51:47	receiver antennae are mounted in an
51:50	aircraft the method is similar to that
51:52	employed in kinematic GP
51:53	surveys in this case the rover is in the
51:57	aircraft which is equipped with a
51:58	photogram photogrammetric camera a
52:00	precise determination is made between
52:02	the GPS antenna and the focal plane of
52:05	the camera this is in fact a mini
52:07	control survey the underlying principle
52:10	is that we are now able to determine
52:11	exactly where the aircraft is during its
52:14	photographic mission we can in turn
52:16	provide coordinates for the aerial
52:18	photographs without the need for ground
52:20	control this will result in significant
52:23	savings as the need for ground control
52:25	and aerial panels is reduced or
52:27	eliminated like many GPS methodologies
52:30	this too has its limitations continuance
52:33	continuous lock on the satellites is
52:35	required between the base receiver and
52:37	the aircraft receiver a seemingly simple
52:39	prospect until you consider that the
52:41	aircraft has to make very shallow banked
52:43	turns so that to preclude the wings from
52:47	coming between the satellite and the
52:49	antenna and the limit the aircraft can
52:51	be from the base receiver is perhaps
52:53	fifty miles there are other potential
52:55	uses of the technology and support of
52:57	surveying operations which are being
52:59	investigated
52:59	I urge you to keep abreast of these
53:01	developments several trade magazines
53:04	including GPS world pob and professional
53:11	surveyor provide continuing coverage of
53:13	developing trends in GPS to primary
53:16	manufacturers of GPS equipment are
53:18	located here in California they have
53:20	been very valuable an accessible source
53:22	of information about GPS technology
53:25	during the past hour or so I have
53:27	attempted to provide you with a broad
53:29	range of issues related to the global
53:30	positioning system technology probably
53:33	the only sure thing which can be said
53:35	about the use of the technology is that
53:37	as continually evolving you should not
53:39	lose sight of the fact that the
53:41	surveying tools the satellites
53:43	themselves and the signals they
53:44	broadcast are basically not changing
53:47	rather it is the new and revolutionary
53:49	ways in which these signals are being
53:51	used that is changing as I discussed in
53:54	the beginning satellite geodesy
53:55	positioning has been around for about
53:57	thirty years it was the advent of GPS
54:00	which made satellite positioning
54:02	technology usable by virtue of by
54:04	virtually every surveyor when properly
54:06	used
54:06	is it is incumbent upon you to follow
54:09	the advances being made and to best
54:11	determine how the technology can be
54:13	employed in your particular survey
54:14	applications but after all it is just
54:17	another survey technology to be employed
54:19	where it is most advantageous thank you
54:22	and good luck |
