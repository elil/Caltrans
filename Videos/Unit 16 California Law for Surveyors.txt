01:51		hello my name is Mitch Duryea I'm the	
01:53		director of surveys for the firm of	
01:55		Norwalk and associates in Santa Clara	
01:57		I received my Bachelor of Science degree	
01:59		in surveying and photogrammetry from the	
02:01		California State University at Fresno in	
02:03		984 I obtained my land surveyors	
02:05		license in 1986 I'm also a part-time	
02:08		instructor in the surveying programs at	
02:10		Evergreen Valley College in San Jose and	
02:13		a City College of San Francisco in this	
02:15		unit we'll be discussing two sections of	
02:17		California statute law that govern the	
02:19		practice of land surveying they are the	
02:21		professional land surveyors act and the	
02:23		subdivision map act this presentation is	
02:25		divided into two sections one for each	
02:27		statute each section will leave again	
02:29		with an introduction and an outline of	
02:31		each statute followed by a detailed	
02:33		discussion of specific sections of the	
02:35		code I'll be making references to	
02:38		examples of maps and other documents in	
02:39		the workbook I'll also discuss the types	
02:42		of questions that you'll see on your	
02:44		exams questions of these statutes will	
02:46		be on the ls exam but not on the lsit	
02:48		exam copies of these two statutes can be	
02:51		obtained from the California land	
02:53		surveyors Association or the California	
02:55		Council of civil engineers and land	
02:57		surveyors because these laws are revised	
02:59		by the legislature on a regular basis it	
03:01		is important that you have the current	
03:03		issue of these statutes the types of	
03:05		questions found in the ls exam	
03:07		under the California law section are	
03:09		usually true/false or short answer short	
03:12		question and answers with the	
03:14		appropriate citations to answer these	
03:16		questions you will not need to have the	
03:18		now the entire statute memorized but	
03:20		will need to quickly find the sections	
03:22		of the statutes a personal indexing	
03:25		system with tabs and highlighted	
03:27		sections will be very helpful for these	
03:28		questions let us now begin the	
03:32		professional Land Surveyors act is a	
03:34		regulatory act being chapter 15 of the	
03:36		business and Professions Code the

14:37		surveys relating to property lines are	
14:39		brought to the public attention record a

14:50		of the deed which has been recorded in	
14:52		the grantee grant or index when a parcel	
14:55		is created constructive notice is served	
14:58		however a record of survey does not	
15:00		create any new parcels it only is a map	
15:02		of the surveys of existing parcels the	
15:05		intent of the law is that all property	
15:06		surveys and property corner monuments	
15:09		would be made of public information in	
15:13		989 the County engineer's Association	
15:16		of California prepared a publication	
15:18		entitled guide to the preparation of	
15:20		records a survey in corner records the	
15:22		purpose of this publication was to	
15:24		develop a statement of procedure for	
15:26		filing records a surveys and coroner	
15:28		records	
15:28		the information presented in this	
15:30		publication is a series of guidelines	
15:32		for the practitioner in the county	
15:34		surveyor in order to provide a more	
15:36		uniform procedure statewide it is not	
15:39		meant for this publication to be the	
15:40		only interpretation of the professional	
15:42		land surveyors Act nor is it meant to be	
15:44		an exhaustive and complete reference it	
15:46		is a tool that outlines the basic	
15:48		responsibilities of the practitioner and	
15:50		the county surveyor in preparing	
15:52		reviewing and finally record a surveys	
15:54		from corner records some of those	
15:56		information presented is not within the	
15:59		professional land surveyors act but is	
16:01		good survey practice according to this	
16:03		publication the professional land

17:14		required to sign the map and to submit	
17:17		the map to their County Recorder the	
17:19		County engineer's Association	
17:20		publication contains an outline and	
17:22		comments on how to prepare the record of	
17:25		survey the steps in this outline are	
17:27		first the map of organization select a	
17:31		map scale such that all information will	
17:32		be legible North arrow should be to the	
17:34		top or to the left of the side of the	
17:36		page the notes and statements are to be	
17:38		on the right side or bottom of the map	
17:40		sheet second to obtain a copy of the	
17:43		County checklist who ensure a	
17:45		completeness upon the first metal the	
17:48		map title is to contain a general	
17:49		location of the survey where the survey	
17:51		was done how many pages the survey is	
17:53		and who is preparing the survey fourth	
17:56		the map is to include a basis of bury	
17:59		note the basis of burying is a line	
18:01		between two monuments that are used to	
18:03		determine the bearings shown upon the	
18:05		map the basis of bearing can be points	
18:07		from a recorded mapper deed from an	
18:09		astronomical observation or from state	
18:12		plane coordinates if the basis of barian	
18:14		is taken from a recorded map or deed is	
18:16		to be between two existing monuments of	
18:19		record which had been made part of the	
18:20		current survey and are shown on the map	
18:22		the bearings and distances of the	
18:24		reference line are is to be shown maps	
18:27		typically acceptable for references	
18:29		purposes include final Maps parcel Maps	
18:31		records or surveys city or county	
18:34		engineering maps and Caltrans right away	
18:36		in monumentation maps the basis of bury	
18:39		note is to include the bearing being	
18:40		used and the document from which	
18:42		was taken if the basis of bearing is	
18:45		from is by astronomical observation the	
18:47		monument in line is to be shown on the	
18:49		map along with the information on how	
18:51		the bearing was calculated a solar or	
18:53		stellar observation for example if the	
18:56		basis of bearing in court and	
18:57		coordinates is taken from the state	
18:59		plane coordinate system the map must	
19:01		show the line or lines connecting the	
19:03		survey to the control points being used	
19:05		show the grid bearings the theta angle	
19:07		the grid and or combined scale factors	
19:10		in preparing the map the body of the map	
19:13		is to prepared in order to clearly	
19:14		convey the survey information the letter	
19:17		is to be lettering is to be placed at	
19:19		them to be most conveniently read with	
19:21		the North arrow pointing away from the	
19:23		reader the adjacent maps are to be shown	
19:25		all found and searched for argument our	
19:28		monuments are to be labeled	
19:29		if the monument is found describe it in	
19:32		detail the characteristics of the	
19:34		monument and the reference to which the	
19:36		document to document the references that	
19:39		to that point being set for example a	
19:42		found three-quarter-inch iron pipe LS	
19:45		number five six six zero and found an	
19:48		amount of rocks per record a survey 485	
19:50		page 19 this can be done with a table if	
19:53		desired if there is no reference for the	
19:55		monument indicates though with origin	
19:57		unknown indicate if the monuments are	
20:00		being accepted or unaccepted this can be	
20:02		done graphically or by note untagged	
20:05		monuments that are accepted and used in	
20:07		the survey should be tagged by the	
20:08		surveyor preparing the map the map is to	
20:11		be legibly prepared language should be	
20:14		carefully selected to convey the	
20:16		information boundary lines of the	
20:18		parcels being surveyed or to have a	
20:20		heavy line street lines are to be	
20:22		thinner center lines and easements are	
20:24		to be a light weight dashed line other	
20:27		special lines that may be used in a	
20:29		survey include county and city limit	
20:31		lines section lines and control lines	
20:33		each line is to be identified in a	
20:36		legend or labeled the lettering on the	
20:38		map is Dupre is to be printed and can be	
20:40		either slanted or vertical the size of	
20:43		the text should be selected such that	
20:45		it'll still be legible when reduced	
20:46		typically three thirty-seconds of an	
20:48		inch is appropriate mapping standards	
20:52		such as these set by the County	
20:54		engineer's Association	
20:55		are useful but his neck is not to be	
20:57		confused on the exam with the actual	
20:59		requirements of the professional answer	
21:01		errors act on your exams only reference	
21:03		the professional and surveyors act now	
21:09		let us turn our attention to corner	
21:10		records corner records are covered in	
21:13		sections 87-73 through eighty seven	
21:15		seventy three point for the purpose of	
21:17		the corner record is to provide by the	
21:19		provide the means by which the	
21:20		reestablishment or rehabilitation of a	
21:23		public land survey corner or other	
21:24		property corners may be filed with the	
21:26		county surveyor and be made of public	
21:29		information corner records for public	
21:31		land survey shall be filed with the	
21:32		county surveyor in the county of which	
21:35		the corner is located the corner record	
21:37		is a read and written record of corner	
21:39		establishment or restoration for every	
21:42		corner established by the survey the	
21:44		public lands of the United States except	
21:46		for lost corners lost corners require	
21:48		that a record a survey be filed per	
21:50		section 87-73	
21:52		when a survey of a parcel of land not a	
21:55		part of the public land survey is	
21:57		completed and a monument of different	
21:59		nature is found with no other material	
22:00		discrepancy then a corner record is to	
22:03		be filed in according to section 87 65 d	
22:07		section 87 73 ste states that a surveyor	
22:11		may file a corner record for any	
22:12		property corner property controlling	
22:14		corner reference monuments or	
22:16		accessories to our property corner	
22:18		section 87 73 point 4 outlines the	
22:21		statutory exemptions to the mandatory	
22:23		filing of a record of a corner record	
22:26		these exemptions are one that a corner	
22:28		record is already on file or two that a	
22:30		record a survey or subdivision map is	
22:33		being recorded another section of state	
22:36		law the surveyors need to be concerned	
22:38		with is that section of law known as the	
22:40		rules of the board of registration for	
22:42		Professional Engineers and land	
22:43		surveyors this code is found in sections	
22:47		00 to 470 of the Administrative Code	
22:49		this code contains the rules and	
22:51		procedures for the border registration	
22:53		included in this code is section 464	
22:56		which details the technical requirements	
22:58		and format for corner records the	
23:01		purpose of the corner record is to	
23:03		provide a vehicle for a short and	
23:05		inexpensive method of making the	
23:07		information regarding the status	
23:08		of survey monumentation available to the	
23:10		public publication prepared by the	
23:13		County engineer's Association of	
23:14		California previously referenced	
23:16		contains an outline for how to prepare a	
23:18		corner record the corner record needs to	
23:21		be legibly drawn and can be an ink or	
23:23		pencil but must be dark enough for	
23:25		duplication and microfilm	
23:26		all signatures need to be in ink make	
23:29		reference to the source of the corner	
23:31		indicate the method used to determine	
23:33		the location of the corner set more than	
23:36		one monument can be shown on a corner	
23:38		record form a corner described in a	
23:41		meets and bounds description and not	
23:42		shown on a map requires that erector to	
23:45		survey be filed a corner record may be	
23:47		filed on Lots within a subdivision where	
23:50		no original corner monuments are shown	
23:52		to be set provided there is no other	
23:54		material discrepancy according to the	
23:57		County engineer's Association it is the	
23:59		responsibility of the surveyor to	
24:01		recognize the conditions permitting the	
24:03		use of a corner record when your	
24:04		monument is reset or rebuilt it is to be	
24:07		a permanent nature it is a	
24:08		responsibility of the county surveyor to	
24:11		examine the corner record pursuant to	
24:12		the professional and surveyors Act the	
24:15		county surveyor is to maintain a file of	
24:17		completed corner records including an	
24:19		assigned document number and an index	
24:21		system in concluding this discussion of	
24:24		the professional and surveyors Act	
24:25		the following are areas of questions	
24:27		that may be asked you may be required to	
24:29		know when a corner record or record a	
24:31		survey is required under what conditions	
24:33		may each be filed and the exemptions	
24:35		from the mandatory filing you may need	
24:38		to know the requirements for obtaining	
24:39		or license the titles the require	
24:41		licensure who may practice in land	
24:43		survey and the practices they require	
24:45		licensed or under the statute this	
24:48		concludes our discussion of the	
24:49		professional and surveyors Act let us	
24:53		now turn our attention to the	
24:54		subdivision map Act subdivision map act	
24:57		is located in Section 66 4 10 through 66	
25:00		for ninety nine point fifty-eight of the	
25:02		government code the subdivision map act	
25:04		is divided into eight sections called	
25:06		chapters these chapters are further	
25:08		divided into articles chapter one is the	
25:11		general provisions and definitions this	
25:13		section contains the definitions used in	
25:15		for the subdivision map act we'll review	
25:18		some of the definitions in order to	
25:20		better understand this gives discussion	
25:22		chapter 2 is maps for this chapter	
25:25		addresses the requirements for a	
25:26		subdivision map and the technical	
25:28		requirements for the various types of	
25:30		Maps chapter 3 is procedure after a map	
25:33		is prepared this chapter outlines the	
25:35		process for approval and record a ssin	
25:37		of the maps chapter 4 is requirements	
25:40		this chapter outlines the basic	
25:41		requirements for subdivisions including	
25:43		public access to public places	
25:45		reservations and dedications fees taxes	
25:49		and monuments as requirements for the	
25:51		approval of a subdivision chapter 4.5	
25:54		development rights this section outlines	
25:56		the rights of the owner or developer of	
25:58		a subdivision chapter 5 is the	
26:01		improvement security section this	
26:03		chapter allows for bonds to be posted to	
26:05		ensure the completion of public	
26:07		improvements that may be part of the	
26:08		requirements of the subdivision chapter	
26:11		 is reversions and exclusions chapter 7	
26:14		is an enforcement and judicial review	
26:17		our discussion will be limited to	
26:19		chapters 1 2 & 3 these are the areas	
26:21		that are most likely to be included on	
26:23		the LS exam dealing with surveying and	
26:25		mapping aspects of the subdivision map	
26:27		act the other chapters deal more with	
26:29		the laws and rules regulating land	
26:31		development and land planning unlike the	
26:34		professional land surveyors act the	
26:36		subdivision map act as an outline for	
26:37		subdividing land each local agency has	
26:40		their own subdivision ordinance to	
26:42		complement the state's subdivision map	
26:43		act let us discuss the following	
26:47		definitions contained in Chapter 1 of	
26:49		the subdivision map act keep in mind	
26:51		that each jurisdiction such as a city	
26:53		town or county is somewhat different	
26:56		first the advisory agency is a	
26:58		designated official or body with the	
27:01		responsibility of making investigations	
27:03		and reports on the design of proposed	
27:05		subdivisions imposing requirements	
27:07		conditions to the subdivision and have	
27:10		authority to approve conditionally	
27:12		approve or disapprove Maps typically	
27:15		this is the Planning Commission with	
27:16		support from planning department staff	
27:18		the appeal board is the designated board	
27:21		or other body responsible for making	
27:23		determinations upon appeals to the	
27:25		conditions made on a subdivision	
27:26		required by the advisory agency	
27:28		typically this is the City Council or	
27:31		Board of Supervisors the city engineers	
27:34		the person authorized to perform the	
27:36		functions of the city engineer the land	
27:38		surveying functions of the city engineer	
27:39		may performed by a city surveyor if that	
27:42		position has been created by the local	
27:44		agency design is defined as Street	
27:47		alignments grades and widths storm and	
27:50		sanitary facilities and utilities	
27:52		location and sizing of easements fire	
27:56		roads and fire breaks lot sizing	
27:58		configuration traffic access grading	
28:01		land to be dedicated for park and	
28:03		recreational purposes and other specific	
28:05		requirements which may be necessary	
28:08		improvements are defined as street	
28:10		working utilities to be installed by the	
28:12		sub divider which are necessary for the	
28:15		general use of the Lots within the	
28:16		subdivision as a condition per percent	
28:19		and to the approval and acceptance of	
28:22		the final map thereof and improvements	
28:26		necessary to ensure consistency with our	
28:28		implementation of the general plan or	
28:30		specific plan the local agencies the	
28:34		city or county or city and county in	
28:36		which the subdivision is located local	
28:39		ordinance are the local ordinances	
28:40		regulating subdivisions the provisions	
28:43		of the local subdivision ordinance are	
28:44		to be consistent with and not in	
28:46		conflict with the state subdivision map	
28:48		act the sub divider is the person or	
28:50		persons who proposes any subdivision his	
28:54		employees are consultants acting in such	
28:56		manner are not subdivide errs section 66	
29:00		24 is an important section of finding	
29:02		what a subdivision is the subdivision is	
29:05		the division of land by any sub divider	
29:08		of any unit or units have improved or	
29:10		unimproved land or any portion thereof	
29:12		shown on the latest equalised county	
29:15		assessment role contiguous for the	
29:19		purpose of sale lease or financing	
29:21		whether immediate or future and	
29:23		tentative map the tentative map or T map	
29:27		is a map made for the purposes of	
29:29		showing the design of a proposed	
29:30		subdivision a tentative map does not	
29:33		need to be based upon a field survey	
29:35		another section of law that deals with	
29:37		subdivisions is called a subdivided	
29:39		Lands Act the subdivided Lands Act is	
29:42		contained in the business and	
29:44		Professions Code it is a consumer	
29:46		protection act similar to the	
29:47		professional land surveyor Zach	
29:49		with a focus on the sale of parcels of	
29:51		land after the subdivision has approved	
29:53		this act it contains the real estate	
29:56		laws administered by the department of	
29:58		real estate or the d-r-e since about	
30:00		965 the d-r-e has the authority over	
30:03		planned developments the purpose of this	
30:05		act is to prevent fraud and	
30:07		misrepresentation in the marketing of	
30:09		parcels of land to accomplish this the	
30:11		d-r-e issues public reports based upon	
30:13		disclosures made by the subdivide er and	
30:16		comparison to the subdivision map act	
30:19		the subdivision map act is contained in	
30:21		the government code and contains the	
30:23		laws that govern the subdivision of land	
30:25		subdivision map act allows for local	
30:27		agencies to regulate and control the	
30:29		design of the subdivision subdivision	
30:32		map act provides for the creation of	
30:34		maps showing the interior and exterior	
30:35		boundaries of subdivisions a good	
30:38		resource book for studying the	
30:40		subdivision map act is the subdivision	
30:42		map act seminar course syllabus prepared	
30:45		by the California Council of civil	
30:46		engineers and land surveyors this book	
30:49		is updated annually to contain any	
30:51		revisions and updates to the Act many	
30:53		sections and provisions to the	
30:54		subdivision map act are direct response	
30:57		to a court decision or an attorney	
30:59		general's opinion these citations and	
31:01		her opinions are discussed in detail in	
31:03		the Cal Council publication let's take a	
31:07		brief look at the history of the	
31:08		subdivision map act in 1907 we saw the	
31:12		first map act in California requiring	
31:14		the filing of a map prior to the sale of	
31:16		real property the only regulation was	
31:19		that the subdivide ur needs to submit	
31:20		the map for checking parcels could be	
31:23		sold by meats and mountains descriptions	
31:24		and therefore the NAP is not really	
31:26		required in 1913 the 1907 act was	
31:30		amended by requiring the map be signed	
31:32		by a land surveyor or civil engineer the	
31:35		920s 9 version was the first major	
31:38		rewrite of the Act tentative maps were	
31:40		created and local subdivision ordinances	
31:42		were allowed sub dividers were now	
31:44		required to improve streets provide	
31:46		minimum lot sizes	
31:47		setbacks and easements in 1937 the Act	
31:51		was now known as the subdivision map act	
31:53		and was placed in the business and	
31:55		Professions Code under this version a	
31:57		record a survey could be used to create	
31:59		parcels of land in 1965 the subdivision	
32:02		a pact was revised to include parcel	
32:05		master for minor subdivisions a minor	
32:08		subdivision is generally four parcels or	
32:10		less	
32:10		major subdivisions are those containing	
32:13		five parcels or more and require a final	
32:15		map in 1974 the subdivision map act was	
32:20		moved from the business and professions	
32:21		code to the government code subdivision	
32:24		map act is now a vehicle for local	
32:25		governments to control and regulate	
32:27		subdivisions and no longer a technical	
32:29		guide on how to prepare the Maps	
32:31		according to the State Attorney General	
32:33		there are three primary goals of the	
32:35		subdivision map act they are first to	
32:37		encourage the orderly community	
32:39		development second to ensure areas	
32:42		within the subdivision that are	
32:43		dedicated for public purposes will be	
32:45		properly improved and not become a	
32:47		burden on the community and three to	
32:49		cope up to protect the public from fraud	
32:54		the subdivision map act is not the	
32:57		exclusive source of law governing	
32:58		subdivisions subdivision map Act	
33:00		requires local agencies to regulate	
33:02		subdivisions by ordinance per section 66	
33:05		11 there is a rule of law called	
33:07		preemption preemption limits the control	
33:10		that a local ordinance may have if a	
33:13		state law completely occupies a given	
33:15		field the state laws just said to be	
33:17		controlling or preempts the local	
33:19		ordinance what this means is that a	
33:21		local agency may not impose requirements	
33:23		or regulations stricter than state law	
33:26		section 66 411 contains several	
33:29		limitations on local subdivision	
33:30		regulations the local agency may not	
33:33		impose design or improvement conditions	
33:35		that would have the effect of rendering	
33:36		infeasible housing for all economic	
33:38		segments of the community the ordinance	
33:41		must consider the effect of the	
33:42		regulation adopt pursuant to the	
33:44		subdivision may effect on the housing	
33:45		needs of the community and the local	
33:47		ordinance must balance the housing needs	
33:49		of the region against the public service	
33:51		needs of the residents and available	
33:53		fiscal and environmental resources given	
33:57		this background in introduction into the	
33:58		subdivision map act we will now look	
34:00		into the Memphian requirements and	
34:02		procedures the approach to take is to	
34:05		look at the project and answer these two	
34:06		questions first is this project a	
34:09		subdivision if so is a map required or	
34:13		is the project exempt from mapping or is	
34:16		the	
34:16		project itself exempt from the	
34:18		subdivision map act entirely the second	
34:21		question is if a map is required then	
34:23		which type of map is a tentative map	
34:26		required or exempt is a final map for	
34:28		parcel map then required approaching the	
34:31		problem in this matter the subdivision	
34:33		map act will make a little more sense	
34:35		and a little bit a little more clear	
34:36		your ability to answer these questions	
34:38		will allow you to answer the problems on	
34:41		the LS exam easily as well let us first	
34:46		ask the question is this project a	
34:49		subdivision section 66 424 defines what	
34:53		a subdivision is there are seven	
34:55		requirements for a project to be a	
34:56		subdivision all seven must be met a	
34:59		subdivision is one a division of any	
35:02		unit or units the number of parcels can	
35:05		either increase or decrease lot mergers	
35:08		are the merging of two parcels into one	
35:09		this process is contained in section 66	
35:12		51 and we will discuss this in detail	
35:15		later a merger however is still a form	
35:18		of a subdivision number two there must	
35:23		be by any sub divider a sub divider is	
35:25		anyone who divides or causes to divide	
35:28		land the consultant is not a sub divider	
35:30		a government agency can be a sub divider	
35:33		however three of any unit or units have	
35:37		improved or unimproved land or any	
35:39		portion thereof basically any parcel of	
35:41		land for shown on the latest day	
35:44		equalized County assessment role	
35:46		remember that the county assessor does	
35:48		not subdivide land his role is to tax	
35:50		property and his maps are made to assist	
35:52		in this process assessor parcels may or	
35:55		may not be legal parcels number five of	
35:58		contiguous units section 66 424 provides	
36:02		in part that property shall be	
36:04		considered as contiguous unit even if it	
36:06		was divided by roads streets utility	
36:09		easements or railroad rights away the	
36:11		example on the screen shows the	
36:12		subdivision of a large parcel into two	
36:14		smaller parcels the large parcel is in	
36:17		fact one large contiguous parcel number	
36:20		six for the purpose of sale lease or	
36:23		financing sale is the conveyance of fee	
36:25		title leases possession for a determined	
36:28		length of time and financing or	
36:31		trust must be made on a legal parcel and	
36:34		finally seven whether a mediator future	
36:37		as a professional you must ask the	
36:39		question what is the intent of the sub	
36:41		divider let us look at a couple of	
36:44		different situations first in the case	
36:47		of gift deeds in harrion's partitions	
36:49		etc are these types of documents subject	
36:51		to comply with the subdivision Mapp Act	
36:54		the answer is that these types of	
36:56		documents would be exempt from the state	
36:58		map act due to the fact that the parcels	
37:01		are created not for sale lease or	
37:03		financing however most local ordinances	
37:06		would have jurisdiction over these quote	
37:07		subdivision verges into section 66 411	
37:11		where the local agency is authorized to	
37:13		cover divisions not code not included in	
37:16		the state map act another situation is	
37:19		in the case of condominiums cooperatives	
37:21		and community apartment projects these	
37:24		are projects which are creating airspace	
37:26		for the purposes of sale lease or	
37:28		financing section 66 424 specifically	
37:32		includes these types of projects as	
37:33		subdivisions another situation arises in	
37:37		government Lots the United States public	
37:40		land survey system included official	
37:42		Maps and Platts which indicated how a	
37:44		section is to be subdivided according to	
37:46		the manual instructions the land is	
37:49		conveyed by a patent using a legal	
37:50		description it is by the patent that the	
37:53		parcels are created not by the Official	
37:55		Plan it was not the intent of the US	
37:57		government to create subdivisions with	
37:59		official survey plots we will now	
38:03		discuss the circumstances under which a	
38:06		subdivision map need not be recorded	
38:08		even though the act would otherwise	
38:09		apply these exclusions and exemptions	
38:12		are throughout the map act there are	
38:14		primarily three types of exemptions the	
38:17		first type is agricultural leases	
38:20		section 66 42 for specifically exempts	
38:23		leases of agricultural land for	
38:24		agricultural purposes in this section	
38:27		agricultural purposes means the	
38:29		cultivation of food or fiber or the	
38:31		pastoring of livestock the second type	
38:35		of exemption is commonly referred to as	
38:37		statutory clauses there are various	
38:39		sections within the map act of such	
38:42		clauses the first that's	
38:44		section is 66 for 12 this section states	
38:48		that the financing or leasing of the	
38:50		following types of projects are exempt	
38:52		from the subdivision impact they are for	
38:54		apartments offices stores industrial	
38:57		commercial buildings mobile home and	
38:59		trailer parks this section also exempts	
39:02		mineral gas leases lands dedicated for	
39:05		cemetery purposes lot line adjustments	
39:07		boundary line agreements with the State	
39:09		Lands Commission any separate tax	
39:11		assessment it's a conversion of a	
39:13		community apartment to a condominium	
39:15		they convergently stock cooperative to	
39:18		come to a condominium and the leasing or	
39:20		granting of an easement to a parcel of	
39:22		land in conjunction with a wind power	
39:24		generation device section 66 4 12.1	
39:28		exempts the financing or leasing of a	
39:31		parcel land in conjunction with the	
39:33		construction of commercial or industrial	
39:34		buildings on a single parcel unless the	
39:37		project is not subject to review on	
39:39		under other local ordinances regulating	
39:41		design and improvement this section also	
39:44		exempts the financing release in a	
39:46		separate commercial buildings or	
39:47		industrial buildings on a single parcel	
39:50		section 66 for 12.2 exempts the	
39:54		construction financing or leasing of	
39:56		dwelling units defined in Section sixty	
39:58		six five eight eight five two point one	
40:02		and sixty five eight five two point two	
40:04		of the government code this exemption is	
40:07		referred to as the granny flat exemption	
40:09		section 66 four twelve point five states	
40:12		when he when provided by local ordinance	
40:15		this division shall be inapplicable to	
40:17		subdivisions of four parcels of less for	
40:19		the construction of removable commercial	
40:21		buildings having a floor area of 100	
40:23		square feet or less this exemption is	
40:26		known as the fotomat clause section 66	
40:29		four twelve point six is known as the	
40:31		TAF provision and addresses parcels	
40:34		created prior to march 4 1972 this	
40:37		section states that if there is no local	
40:39		ordinance regulating the subdivision of	
40:42		land into for a few parcels the parcel	
40:44		is considered lawful this provision	
40:47		requires that a certificate of	
40:48		compliance be obtained by the local	
40:50		agency for such parcels the third type	
40:54		of exemption or exclusion is conveyances	
40:56		tore from a public agency	
40:58		section 66 for 26.5 say that any	
41:01		conveyance of land to a government	
41:03		agency public entity or public utility	
41:06		shall not be considered a division of	
41:07		land for the purposes of computing the	
41:09		number of parcels for example if a	
41:12		parcel of land is to be granted to the	
41:13		city for parkland than it is not to be	
41:16		counted as a parcel therefore there is	
41:18		no division of land as defined by	
41:20		section 66 424 section 66 428 further	
41:25		states that a parcel map shall not be	
41:27		required for the land convey tour from a	
41:29		governmental agency public entity or	
41:32		public utility for the purposes of	
41:33		conveying a right-of-way we have now	
41:38		answered the first question is this a	
41:40		subdivision if the answer is yes	
41:42		we must now determine which type of map	
41:44		is required the subdivision map act	
41:47		recognizes three types of subdivision	
41:49		Maps the tentative map or T map the	
41:52		parcel map and final map the subdivision	
41:55		map act of approval is a two-step	
41:57		process the tentative map is the	
41:59		document utilized to obtain the	
42:01		first-level approval the T map is used	
42:03		to convey the intent of the design of	
42:05		the subdivision the parcel map or final	
42:08		map is the document used for final	
42:10		approval parcel map and final map are	
42:12		the only documents that get recorded	
42:14		they also convey constructive notice	
42:16		upon record ation there are three major	
42:19		differences between parcel maps and	
42:21		final maps the differences may vary	
42:23		between local agencies however parcel	
42:26		maps are used for minor subdivisions	
42:28		typically consisting of four or fewer	
42:31		parcels a parcel map may be compiled	
42:34		from record data or a field survey final	
42:37		maps are used for major subdivisions and	
42:39		usually of five or more parcels the map	
42:42		is also called a tract map or	
42:43		subdivision map depending upon local	
42:45		ordinance the final map must be based	
42:48		upon a field survey and sometimes	
42:50		require larger dedications fee or	
42:52		improvement requirements it is important	
42:55		to know when a final map is required or	
42:57		when a parcel map is allowed section 66	
43:00		26 states a tentative and final map	
43:03		show required for all subdivisions	
43:05		creating five or more parcels five or	
43:08		more economy and condominiums as defined	
43:10		in Section 783	
43:12		of the civil code a community apartment	
43:14		project containing five or more parcels	
43:16		or the conversion of a dwelling to a	
43:19		stock cooperative containing five or	
43:21		more dwelling units the section	
43:23		continues to lease five exceptions to	
43:25		this rule if a project falls under one	
43:27		of these five exceptions a parcel map	
43:29		will then need to be recorded first the	
43:33		exception to the final map requirement	
43:34		is the is called a small parcel	
43:36		exception the land before the division	
43:39		must be less than five acres each parcel	
43:41		created a blessing may must abut a	
43:44		maintained public street and noting it	
43:46		dedications or improvements are required	
43:48		the second exception to the final map	
43:51		requirement is called the twenty acre	
43:52		rule each parcel created is to be twenty	
43:56		acres or larger and has approved access	
43:58		to a public street the commercial	
44:01		development exception is when parcels	
44:04		created have access to a public street	
44:05		and the land is owned for industrial or	
44:07		commercial development the nest	
44:10		exception is called the forty acre	
44:12		exception each parcel of land created	
44:15		has a gross area of not less than 40	
44:16		acres or less than 1/16 of a section	
44:19		final exemption is called the section 66	
44:22		28 exception this section states that a	
44:25		local agency shall provide a procedure	
44:27		for waiving the requirements of a parcel	
44:29		map another question that is commonly	
44:33		asked is whether successive subdivisions	
44:35		of adjoining parcels are counted	
44:37		together and determining of four or five	
44:39		parcels result from a subdivision or	
44:42		counted separately this is referred to	
44:44		as tacking or 4x4 een the question is if	
44:48		a parcel of land is divided into four	
44:50		parcels then one of those new parcels is	
44:53		divided into four additional parcels	
44:54		what type of map is required if the	
44:58		adjoining subdivisions are unrelated	
45:00		that is independently owned different	
45:03		sub divider etc the parcels are not	
45:05		counted any parcel mapper will be	
45:07		required if the projects are related	
45:10		then the parcels will be counted any	
45:13		final map will be required and counting	
45:16		the number of parcels to be to determine	
45:18		if a final map or parcel map is required	
45:20		there are two sections to be	
45:22		reconsidered section 66 426	
45:25		point five is the section that says lang	
45:27		conveyed to or from a public right	
45:29		public entity is not counted as a parcel	
45:31		section 66 four to four point six	
45:35		discusses the designated remainder	
45:37		parcel we will not discussed it as a	
45:39		designated remainder rule only that if a	
45:42		parcel is so designated on the map it	
45:44		will not be counted as a parcel for the	
45:46		purpose of parcel map versus final map	
45:48		designation once a type of map has been	
45:52		determined	
45:53		let us now our attention turn our	
45:55		attention to the preparation of these	
45:56		maps the subdivision map Act does not	
45:59		give much detail on the required	
46:01		contents of a tentative map section 66	
46:04		four to four point five is the only	
46:06		reference to the content which indicates	
46:08		the T map is made for the purpose of	
46:09		showing the design and improvement of a	
46:11		proposed subdivision including the	
46:13		existing conditions section 66 for	
46:16		seventy four point one states that the	
46:18		final map or parcel map blessed me in	
46:19		substantial compliance with the approved	
46:21		tentative map the local agency has a	
46:24		great deal freedom in defining what he	
46:26		what is required on tentative maps on	
46:29		the screen is a sample tentative map	
46:31		showing topography Lots cubes and other	
46:33		design and improvement criteria the	
46:36		subdivision map act does not address in	
46:38		detail the technical requirements for	
46:41		parcel maps and final maps section 66 4	
46:45		4 through 66 450 established the form	
46:48		and content for the parcel map section	
46:51		6 4 33 through 443 outlined the	
46:54		requirements for the final map technical	
46:57		requirements in these sections are	
46:58		similar to the requirements of a record	
46:59		a survey the maps are to be allegedly	
47:02		drawn printed or reproduced by a process	
47:04		guaranteeing a permanent record in black	
47:06		on tracing cloth or polyester film base	
47:08		the maps would be 18 by 26 inches in	
47:11		size with the 1 inch blank border on	
47:13		each side all surveying mathematical	
47:15		information and data necessary to locate	
47:17		all monuments and to locate and retrace	
47:20		any and all interior & exterior boundary	
47:21		lines shall be shown each parcel and lot	
47:24		is to be so numbered and each Street is	
47:26		to be named or otherwise designated the	
47:29		exterior boundary of the land is to	
47:31		included within the subdivision shall be	
47:33		indicated by a distinctive symbols and	
47:35		so designated the maps must have a	
47:38		surveyor statement	
47:39		city or county engineer statement	
47:41		recorder statement and other statements	
47:43		as required by local ordinance these and	
47:45		maps must also be signed by the owners	
47:47		of the property the owner signatures	
47:49		must be notarized parcel maps and final	
47:52		maps must be prepared by license land	
47:54		surveyor or a registered civil engineer	
47:56		license to practice land surveying	
48:00		chapter three of the subdivision map act	
48:02		outlines the procedures and for the	
48:05		processing approval conditional approval	
48:07		or disapproval and filing of tentative	
48:09		final and parcel maps the time limits	
48:12		specified in this chapter may be	
48:13		extended by mutual consent of the	
48:15		subdivide er and the advisory agency per	
48:18		Section 66 for 51 point 1 section 66 for	
48:23		1 point to allows for the local agency	
48:25		to charge fees for the processing of	
48:27		maps and other procedures that may be	
48:29		required section 66 for 51.3 contains

49:09		outline the procedures for approving and	
49:11		recording a final map some projects may	
49:13		allow for multiple final maps to be	
49:15		recorded on a single tenet of map first	
49:17		section 66 for 56.1 these sections also	
49:21		address	
49:22		time limits requirements and other	
49:25		specifications for the improvement plans	
49:27		and other dedications section 66 for

50:06		a subdivision has taken place pursuant	
50:08		to section 66 468 once the map has	
50:12		recorded and there is NER found the map	
50:14		can be corrected with either the	
50:15		certificate of Correction or an amended	
50:17		map section 66 469 outlines this	
50:21		procedure which we have discussed under	
50:22		the record a survey section of this	
50:24		presentation there are three additional	
50:27		topics besides the mapping process that	
50:30		we have discussed that need to be	
50:32		brought to your attention	
50:33		they are law line adjustments parcel	
50:36		mergers and certificates of compliance	
50:38		lot line adjustments are covered and	
50:41		addressed and addressed in section 66	
50:43		12 D and what line adjustment is when	
50:47		there are two or existing parcels of	
50:49		land and land is being taken from one	
50:52		parcel and being added to or the other	
50:54		and a greater number of parcels is not	
50:56		created the adjustment must be approved	
50:58		by the local agency the local agency	
51:02		must limit the review to determine that	
51:04		the resulting parcels will not conform	
51:06		the three zone parcels will conform to	
51:09		local zoning and building ordinances the	
51:11		local agency will doubt cannot require a	
51:14		tentative map or final map or parcel map	
51:17		parcel mergers are covered in article 1	
51:21		point 5 of chapter 3 of the state map	
51:23		act a merger is when you have two	
51:25		separate parcels and the subdivide ur	
51:27		desires to have one larger parcel	
51:29		section 66 450 1.11 outlined the	
51:33		requirements for a lot merger the code	
51:36		addresses the procedures for the mergers	
51:38		along into mergers initiated by local	
51:40		agencies and how to unmerge merged	
51:43		parcels the a certificate of compliance	
51:47		is a legal document recorded by the	
51:49		local agency stating in essence that the	
51:52		parcel in question was created legally	
51:55		prior to the enactment of the state	
51:57		subdivision map act or local subdivision	
52:00		ordinance or is in compliance with the	
52:02		local ordinance prior to the enactment	
52:04		of the state map act	
52:05		is the responsibility of the sub divider	
52:07		to prove that the parcel was legally	
52:09		created section 66 499 point 35	
52:13		addresses the specific procedures and	
52:16		requirements for certificates of	
52:18		compliance this concludes our discussion	
52:22		of the professional land surveyor is a	
52:23		land surveyors act and the subdivision	
52:26		map act I have attempted to highlight	
52:28		the section of these codes that will be	
52:29		covered on the LS exam a more thorough	
52:32		study and preparation will be required	
52:34		prior to taking the exam good luck with	
52:36		studying and good luck with your career
