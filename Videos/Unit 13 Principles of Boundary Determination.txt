00:48		welcome to Caltrans lsi TLS exam	
00:51		preparation course one aid in your	
00:55		preparation for California licensure	
00:57		examinations a word of caution don't use	
01:01		this course as your only preparation	
01:03		devise and follow a regular schedule of	
01:06		study which begins months before the	
01:09		tests work many problems in each area	
01:12		not just those in this courses workbook	
01:15		but problems from other sources as well	
01:19		this course is funded by Caltrans but	
01:22		you and I owe a profound thanks to	
01:25		others the courses instructors from the	
01:28		academic community the private sector	
01:30		other public agencies and from Caltrans	
01:34		as well we wish you well in your study	
01:38		toward becoming a member of California's	
01:39		professional land surveying community a	
01:46		diligent thorough and complete search	
01:49		for all evidence is the fundamental	
01:52		essence of land surveying Curtis M Brown	
01:57		welcome to the boundary determination	
01:59		module of the Caltrans video training	
02:02		course I am Robert Macomb I entered the	
02:07		land surveying discipline during my	
02:08		summer months as a student at the	
02:11		University of California where I studied	
02:13		physics later I became an employee at	
02:17		private surveying firms acquiring my	
02:19		professional license in 1977 since then	
02:24		I have owned and operated a private	
02:26		cadastral surveying company in a small	
02:28		mountain community in Southern	
02:30		California during the 80s I wrote exam	
02:34		problems and also served as an examiner	
02:37		today I'm going to introduce to you in	
02:40		the form of a story the fundamentals of	
02:43		boundaries surveying through the	
02:45		adventures of a fictitious survey party	
02:48		throughout my presentation I will	
02:51		comment on their discovery process and	
02:53		the evidence they gather their mistakes	
02:56		will be instructive their decisions	
02:59		issues for	
03:00		eight surveying is not usually as	
03:04		difficult as you will observe not	
03:07		usually I say because sooner or later	
03:09		every surveyor experiences a similar	
03:11		story this lesson is not just a listing	
03:15		of boundary principles with a picture to	
03:17		go with each that would be less than	
03:20		desirable you would learn little to help	
03:22		you pass the exam and little to carry	
03:25		forward into your career the	
03:28		professional exam demands that you	
03:30		demonstrate expertise the test does not	
03:33		reward the amateurs ability to memorize	
03:35		a list of facts the test will require	
03:40		you to solve problems exemplary of	
03:42		real-life the problems will require a	
03:45		synthesis of research evidence knowledge	
03:48		of principles and decisions which if	
03:51		they were made in the real world would	
03:54		make you financially liable let's	
03:57		experience some boundary principles in	
03:59		the surveyors true environment I will	
04:02		begin with a series of definitions and	
04:04		then I will proceed to the survey of the	
04:08		Sundance ranch watch carefully	
04:10		there will be a test later boundary	
04:17		retracement is the essential task done	
04:20		by surveyors a boundary is defined by a	
04:23		deed retracing a boundary involves a	
04:26		reconstruction of the conditions and	
04:28		directives that originally set down the	
04:30		legal description contained in the deed	
04:32		a legal description is like a map	
04:36		without lines and arrows although	
04:38		sometimes it may refer to an actual map	
04:41		when a map is referenced a legal	
04:44		description may be greatly clarified to	
04:48		illustrate these various terms consider	
04:51		the following description of buried	
04:52		treasure and follow it on the map shown	
04:56		beginning at the grave then spaced due	
05:00		west until the palm tree comes into view	
05:03		thence go 200 paces in the direction of	
05:06		the shipwreck to the X marked upon the	
05:08		sand dig down 4 fathoms	
05:13		this example has all the trappings we	
05:16		need to demonstrate a modern boundary	
05:18		retracement to find the buried treasure	
05:20		we would follow the courses provided	
05:22		using the map to help us interpret the	
05:25		terms given this map and description is	
05:29		fine provided the treasure has been	
05:31		freshly buried the description is	
05:33		recently written the map is available	
05:35		and there is no confusion about the	
05:38		meaning intended by the description what	
05:41		happens over time is quite a different	
05:43		story over time many of the terms of the	
05:47		description will break down into	
05:48		ambiguities for example suppose more	
05:52		grave sites came into being the palm	
05:55		tree cannot live forever or worse	
05:57		another could grow near it the shipwreck	
06:00		might never be found once it becomes	
06:02		submerged completely and the X in the	
06:06		sand well few things are less perpetual	
06:10		as time goes on it will become	
06:12		increasingly more difficult to find the	
06:14		correct information needed to retrace	
06:16		the description even with the map there	
06:20		may come a day when the treasure is lost	
06:22		forever that is why a surveyor depends	
06:25		so much on good records the success of a	
06:28		search is proportional to the effort of	
06:31		the research in practice the lion's	
06:36		share of surveying is done off the job	
06:38		site researching and reading it would be	
06:42		nice if the tasks were as simple as our	
06:44		treasure hunt but surveyors do not	
06:46		follow maps to buried treasure and X	
06:49		never ever marks the spot	
06:52		fortunately great progress has been made	
06:55		since the days of treasure maps in	
06:58		setting down ways of finding buried	
07:00		objects or more to the point for severe	
07:03		ways of finding a land boundary however	
07:07		at least one basic idea of the past	
07:09		remains the same we continue to use	
07:12		everyday language to uniquely describe	
07:14		the location of a boundary so that it	
07:18		will have the best chance of being found	
07:19		again	
07:21		a non-ambiguous deed depends upon those	
07:24		important words uniquely described	
07:28		throughout history disagreements have	
07:31		erupted over the intent of deeds that	
07:34		were thought to be clear when written	
07:35		but whose meanings became lost over time	
07:38		particularly in cases were the deeds	
07:41		physical representations the monuments	
07:43		have disappeared with these pitfalls in	
07:47		mind we stand before the entrance to	
07:50		what is arguably the most involved	
07:52		subject of land surveying boundary	
07:55		determination which involves the use of	
07:57		boundary principles what our boundary	
08:01		principles they are the rules needed to	
08:04		resolve ambiguities arising from the	
08:07		loss of information not properly	
08:09		perpetuated on paper or on the ground	
08:13		many boundary principles to be discussed	
08:16		during the next two hours were derived	
08:18		from land disputes brought to the courts	
08:20		for judgment among them are those cases	
08:24		where the written terms of a deed	
08:25		conflicted others derived from simple	
08:30		interpretations of common and civil law	
08:32		and matters not so much in conflict but	
08:35		in need of a good dose of common sense	
08:39		every professional surveyor needs a	
08:42		personal library that includes a	
08:44		reference section on boundary	
08:46		determination the principles of boundary	
08:49		determination can be found in the books	
08:51		listed in the reference section at the	
08:53		end of the boundary determination unit	
08:55		of your workbook your success with the	
08:58		exam will depend to a large extent on	
09:01		your ability to understand and use at	
09:04		least one of these boundary references	
09:07		let me proceed now to the story of our	
09:10		surveyors the setting is a project of	
09:13		ranging complexity 1 which contains a	
09:16		storehouse of traps and contradictions	
09:18		which I will use to demonstrate a	
09:20		multitude of boundary principles	
09:28		the melodrama begins on a crisp morning	
09:31		in the mountain community of Monument	
09:32		Valley a fresh survey crew has occupied	
09:36		a random point on a peak overlooking a	
09:38		peaceful River the party chief pours hot	
09:41		coffee from a thermos and opens his	
09:44		research package for the first time the	
09:47		information seems friendly enough an	
09:49		innocent-looking subdivision on the	
09:51		assessor's map his company has been	
09:54		hired by the Sundance Ranch partnership	
09:57		to survey their land known locally as	
10:00		the Sundance ranch together with a	
10:03		0-foot ride Road which serves the land	
10:07		the office researcher has seen fit to	
10:10		provide several documents that will come	
10:13		into play at one time or another there	
10:16		are two maps the first a subdivision map	
10:19		recorded by an L Parker in 1920 the	
10:23		second and unrecorded Platte signed by	
10:25		an L Baltimore in 1905 the subdivision	
10:31		map shows nine Lots surrounding the	
10:33		Sundance ranch shown is a simplified	
10:36		version of the subdivision map a little	
10:40		more explanation is going to be helpful	
10:41		we have the following facts the original	
10:45		map states that all lines of the	
10:46		subdivision Barrett right angles to each	
10:48		other except the river in highway most	
10:51		of the monuments set for the boundary	
10:53		consist of 2x2 redwood Stakes or hubs if	
10:56		you prefer the rest are iron pins	
10:59		including the angle points along the	
11:01		sidelines of the 60-foot road which is	
11:04		dedicated the lot dimensions are not	
11:07		particularly relevant and are not shown	
11:09		this map is also a basis of a problem in	
11:13		your companion workbook the crews work	
11:19		seems to be cut out for them all they	
11:22		have to do is find the original corners	
11:23		of the ranch and the 60 foot road	
11:26		leading to it the party chief dispatches	
11:29		his chain Minh to the site of the	
11:31		Sundance Ranch where they begin to make	
11:32		an inspection for monuments nothing is	
11:35		turned up after two hours of pacing come	
11:38		passing and mag	
11:39		searching and of course a great amount	
11:43		of shoveling apparently this subdivision	
11:46		is about as dry as they come while the	
11:50		chain men are scratching around fence	
11:52		corners and discovering old beer cans	
11:54		and pieces of barbed wire the party	
11:56		chief gets down to the basic paperwork	
11:59		the Sundance ranch partnership deed is	
12:02		only a few lines long he fully expects	
12:06		the description to refer to the Sundance	
12:08		ranch as shown on the subdivision map	
12:11		read and weep the north easterly twelve	
12:17		hundred and fifty feet of L Parker's	
12:19		land in Section six	
12:21		accepting the North 700 feet and the	
12:25		east six hundred and sixty feet	
12:27		containing an area of eight point four	
12:30		five acres suddenly life has become a	
12:35		lot more difficult surprisingly this	
12:37		deed contains no reference to the	
12:39		subdivision map although corners for the	
12:41		ranch were set by the sub divider at the	
12:44		time of the subdivision the shape and	
12:47		location of the Sundance ranch	
12:49		partnership land is not controlled by	
12:51		the subdivision map but by the north and	
12:53		east lines of Parker's land once the	
12:57		location of Parker's land is known the	
12:59		precise location of the Sundance ranch	
13:01		will follow based upon the rule that	
13:04		measurements and descriptions based upon	
13:07		the preposition of are made at right	
13:09		angles to the boundary specified unless	
13:12		stated otherwise in the graphic shown	
13:16		Parker's land is depicted ideally with	
13:19		perpendicular north and east lines it	
13:24		does not matter how acute the angle	
13:26		between Parker's north and east lines	
13:28		might actually be the right angle rule	
13:31		will ensure that the ranch boundaries	
13:33		distort in kind because Parker's deed is	
13:37		called out in the deed to the Sundance	
13:40		ranch partnership Parker's D becomes a	
13:43		part of the Sundance ranch partnership	
13:45		deed the partnership deed is an example	
13:50		of a nested description one which refers	
13:53		to a	
13:53		least one prior deed for its full	
13:55		wording this is typical of metes and	
13:58		bounds descriptions where nested	
14:01		descriptions are a fact of life our	
14:05		party chief should consider himself	
14:06		fortunate if Parker's deed does not	
14:09		refer back to an even earlier deed his	
14:12		next task is to read the parker deed the	
14:16		competent office researcher has done her	
14:18		homework and provided him with a copy	
14:26		Parker's deed is a document recorded in	
14:29		905 the grantor was an EM Cassady it	
14:33		reads as follows all that land in	
14:36		Section six described as follows	
14:40		beginning at the old Sequoia on the hill	
14:42		north of town thence toward the center	
14:45		of the bridge crossing the river to an	
14:48		intersection with the North line of said	
14:50		section six and the true point of	
14:52		beginning thence continuing toward the	
14:55		bridge one thousand seven hundred feet	
14:58		and so on this is only the beginning of	
15:03		Parker's description it continues in a	
15:06		clockwise direction around the apparent	
15:09		boundary of Parker's subdivision as a	
15:13		natural Monument our party chief	
15:15		realizes that the Sequoia tree must be	
15:18		regarded as the irrefutable beginning of	
15:20		the deed natural monuments are highest	
15:23		in the hierarchy of evidence used to	
15:25		establish lines upon the ground with the	
15:28		exception of senior title if it is	
15:30		contrary the bridge and the Sequoia are	
15:34		well-known landmarks in the area still	
15:37		how can he be sure that this is the same	
15:41		tree in bridge that existed at the time	
15:43		of the deeds execution locating the	
15:47		center of the bridge may be easier said	
15:50		than done	
15:50		even for our intrepid crew there may be	
15:54		some relief however in the form of the	
15:57		second of the two maps the plat drawn by	
15:59		El Baltimore in 1905 which was not	
16:03		recorded	
16:06		Baltimore's Platt appears to show	
16:08		certain land ownerships that existed at	
16:11		the time of his survey by the way the	
16:15		companion workbook involves parties	
16:17		Smith and Jones in a difficulty	
16:19		involving simultaneous conveyances like	
16:23		all problems in the workbook this is	
16:25		typical of test questions found on the	
16:27		professional exam unlike the subdivision	
16:32		map this plat is not a simplified	
16:34		version everything is shown that the	
16:37		party chief sees this means that	
16:40		although monument symbols may be	
16:41		apparent	
16:42		none of them are described in a legend	
16:44		or labeled on the original map the party	
16:48		chief notices a monument symbol on the	
16:51		bridge possibly at the center of the	
16:53		bridge as it was mentioned in Parker's	
16:55		deed the apparent midpoint of the bridge	
17:00		appears to be obvious when intersecting	
17:02		it's symmetrical head walls these head	
17:05		walls are old and appear to be the	
17:07		original workings of the bridge however	
17:10		the chain man's magnetic locator	
17:12		indicates a distinct signal about nine	
17:15		feet off the bridges Center as placed by	
17:17		these head walls after an hour of	
17:20		chipping through deep asphalt the party	
17:23		Chiefs curiosity is satisfied a six inch	
17:26		square iron plate bearing the	
17:28		inscription Baltimore 1905 is uncovered	
17:34		let's ponder this discovery for a moment	
17:38		the obvious question is this does the	
17:42		existence of Baltimore's plat with its	
17:45		monument symbol at the bridge force us	
17:48		to accept this monument as the center of	
17:50		the bridge the party chief realizes that	
17:54		this question carries with it a bundle	
17:57		of liability he wisely chooses to pit	
18:00		the situation against the following	
18:02		important criterion a map must be called	
18:06		for in a legal description to become a	
18:09		legal part of the description	
18:14		he therefore concludes that the 6-inch	
18:16		plate cannot be taken as a point of	
18:19		Parker's deed I would like to further	
18:21		emphasize this criterion by saying that	
18:24		even if Baltimore's disk were to bear	
18:26		the inscription quote this point lies on	
18:29		the subtly prolongation of the East line	
18:32		of the parker deed unquote it would	
18:35		still have to be rejected as the written	
18:37		intent of the deed the language of a	
18:40		deed is controlled by its written terms	
18:42		and all terms of the deed are assumed to	
18:45		be present on the other hand how certain	
18:50		can anyone be that the center of the	
18:52		bridge is defined by its four	
18:54		symmetrical head walls for all we know	
18:57		the original parties who transacted the	
19:00		deed may have stood at the old Sequoia	
19:02		tree impaired at the bridge through a	
19:04		transit splitting the two northerly head	
19:07		walls does this possibility make the	
19:11		meaning of the term center of the bridge	
19:13		ambiguous when may a surveyor suppose	
19:17		that an ambiguity exists and when may he	
19:21		not I'll return to this feisty question	
19:24		a little later under the topic of intent	
19:27		as to a decision regarding the bridge	
19:31		our party chief chooses wisely by	
19:34		adopting the center derived by all four	
19:36		head walls with the East line under	
19:43		their belt our illustrious crew turns	
19:45		its attention to Parker's North line the	
19:48		other line needed to survey the Sundance	
19:50		Ranch partnership Dean Parker's North	
19:53		Line is the North line of Section six	
19:56		but this is not just any section six	
19:59		this one abuts a standard parallel the	
20:04		party chief recalls from his knowledge	
20:05		of Township surveys that the sections	
20:08		north and south of a standard parallel	
20:10		are shifted east or west of each other	
20:12		depending on the relative location of	
20:14		the meridian this shift causes separate	
20:18		monuments four sections north and south	
20:20		of the parallel	
20:23		to get started he looks among his	
20:26		research materials for a map showing how	
20:28		the standard parallel was monumental	
20:30		this map turns out to be a US GL o	
20:34		dependent resurvey plat from 1912	
20:37		although not shown the government	
20:40		surveyor in 1912 set the South line of	
20:43		section 31 along a curved line of	
20:46		latitude which is the correct procedure	
20:48		for any parallel whether it's a standard	
20:51		one or not that being the case the south	
20:55		quarter corner of section 31 would be	
20:58		expected to lie a little to the south of	
21:00		the line connecting the southwest in	
21:02		southeast section corners next he looks	
21:07		at a 1915 u.s. GL o dependent resurvey	
21:12		plat showing how corners were set for	
21:15		Section six to the south he notes that	
21:18		this plot shows unusual monuments called	
21:21		closing corners at the northwest and	
21:23		northeast corners of section 6	
21:26		he and his diligent crew attempt to	
21:29		recover these various corners along the	
21:32		standard parallel the crew splits up to	
21:36		accelerate the search the chain man's	
21:40		failure to find the north quarter corner	
21:42		of section six is not surprising North	
21:45		quarter corners usually were not set for	
21:47		section south of and abutting standard	
21:49		parallels the chain person has better	
21:53		success with two of the corners of	
21:55		section 31 the south quarter corner and	
21:57		the southeast corner unfortunately the	
22:00		northeast corner of section six is most	
22:03		certainly lost as the party chief is	
22:07		scratching around for the northeast	
22:09		corner of section six a local resident	
22:12		approaches him holding an	
22:13		official-looking monument in his hand	
22:17		the cap on the monument bears the USG	
22:21		ello stamp date in section designation	
22:24		the resident explains that a few years	
22:27		ago he witnessed a blade operator	
22:29		hitting this monument he points to an	
22:32		old tree trunk against which he says the	
22:35		original corner once stood	
22:36		the party chief no longer considers the	
22:39		original closing corner to be lost but	
22:42		merely obliterated an obliterated corner	
22:47		is defined as the corner that may be	
22:49		reestablished by some form of evidence	
22:53		accurately indicating its original	
22:56		location other than the original map or	
23:00		plat a lost corner is one lacking any	
23:03		such evidence original government	
23:07		corners may be restored at the spot	
23:09		indicated by a resident who saw the	
23:11		original corner and knows where its	
23:14		former location was as long as the	
23:17		knowledge is firsthand the term	
23:20		obliterated is generally not used for	
23:22		monuments other than government corners	
23:25		but the same rules of evidence apply for	
23:28		non-government corners as well in this	
23:32		lesson the term obliterated can apply to	
23:35		any monument intended to define a	
23:37		boundary obliterated corners can be	
23:42		restored by several means the most	
23:44		common is by using other monuments whose	
23:47		relative locations to the obliterated	
23:49		corner are shown unacceptable plots such	
23:52		as recorded Maps unrecorded plots of	
23:56		surveyors and in rare cases the plots of	
23:59		lay persons may be used as Testaments to	
24:02		the locations of original corners always	
24:06		scrutinize such sources carefully	
24:09		because a surveyor may accept the work	
24:13		or a plat of another surveyor as	
24:15		evidence for the re-establishment of an	
24:18		obliterated corner but he must accept	
24:20		the liability for errors and omissions	
24:22		in the work of others he chooses to use	
24:26		obliterated corners may also be	
24:29		recovered by accepting existing	
24:31		monuments that appear to be replacements	
24:33		of originals these should be thoroughly	
24:37		verified by contacting the surveyor	
24:39		whose registration mark appears on the	
24:41		monument should there be no registration	
24:44		mark as is often the case with old or	
24:47		damaged monuments there may be no	
24:50		recourse	
24:50		but rejection certification of an	
24:53		unidentifiable monument carries risks	
24:56		that are potentially damaging there are	
25:00		other even more tenuous means of	
25:02		recovering obliterated monuments for	
25:06		instance an improvement built at the	
25:08		time the original monument was known to	
25:10		exist is acceptable if you can prove the	
25:13		original monument control the	
25:15		improvement lines of possession such as	
25:19		fences are particularly controversial be	
25:22		especially careful here your evidence	
25:26		will need to be strong and may come	
25:28		under very close scrutiny by other	
25:30		surveyors or by the court	
25:33		this method of recovering obliterated	
25:36		monuments has been greatly abused and is	
25:38		often challenged only the courts may	
25:43		decide upon land ownership this is the	
25:48		fundamental limitation of the land	
25:50		surveyor a surveyor locates boundaries	
25:54		according to legal descriptions the	
25:56		courts and only the courts decide	
25:58		ownership and property rights issues	
26:02		unwritten rules of title may apply in	
26:05		similar situations such as adverse	
26:08		possession defined by lines of	
26:10		possession here the surveyors obligation	
26:14		to the client is one of disclosure a	
26:17		surveyors duty is to map the location of	
26:20		encroachments such as fences and	
26:22		structures that fall across deed lines	
26:24		and inform his client in writing as to	
26:28		the facts having taken the residents	
26:32		testimony our party chief perpetuates	
26:35		the location of the original closing	
26:37		corner in accordance with the land	
26:39		surveyors act by setting his own durable	
26:41		monument for example a 2-inch iron pipe	
26:44		with brass discs burying his	
26:46		registration number that same resident	
26:50		also mentions that he is aware of the	
26:52		location of the lost north quarter	
26:54		corner of Section six premises knowledge	
26:57		on information given to him by his	
26:59		grandfather his offer to help is decline	
27:03		it is explained to him that third party	
27:06		testimony is considered hearsay and	
27:08		cannot be used to restore monuments	
27:11		anytime there is hearsay concerning	
27:14		evidence in a survey it must be rejected	
27:16		not as a possible fact but as a legal	
27:19		fact as a possible fact it may beg	
27:23		further investigation focusing on the	
27:27		North line of the section the cruise	
27:28		ties to the three available monuments	
27:31		along the standard parallel reveal a	
27:33		discrepancy in their expected alignment	
27:36		the Northeast closing corner of section	
27:39		six is a little over four feet south of	
27:42		the standard parallel does this cause an	
27:45		angle point in the standard parallel for	
27:49		the answer to this our party chief	
27:51		checks directly with the manual of	
27:53		instructions in it he reads a closing	
27:56		corner not actually located on the line	
27:59		that was closed upon will determine the	
28:01		direction of the closing line but not	
28:03		it's legal terminus the correct position	
28:06		is at the true point of intersection of	
28:08		the two lines incidentally you shouldn't	
28:13		be going to the test without the manual	
28:15		of instructions know it thoroughly	
28:18		several questions in the workbook will	
28:20		test your ability to navigate for	
28:22		answers deep within the waters of the	
28:24		manual our party chief thinks the	
28:28		recovered northeast corner of section	
28:30		six might control Parker's East line as	
28:33		well as his north line he knows that	
28:37		Parker's deed is not controlled by the	
28:39		section corner but by the tree bridge	
28:41		line however he sees a puzzling	
28:44		coincidence	
28:47		Baltimore splat shows a distance of	
28:49		exactly 660 feet from the tree bridge	
28:52		line to the northeast corner of Section	
28:55		six this is a familiar distance exactly	
28:58		one eighth of a mile and an incredible	
29:01		coincidence the party chief suspects	
29:05		there may be a problem with Parker's	
29:08		deed his next step is to verify the	
29:12		suspicious 660 feet by looking at a	
29:15		certain deed	
29:16		which he happens to have among his	
29:18		research materials	
29:19		the year was 1895 the grantee and M	
29:24		Cassidy who later passed title to Parker	
29:29		Cassidy's ownership is shown in the	
29:31		graphic and reads as follows all of	
29:34		Section six except the East one eighth	
29:38		also excepting the West one half also	
29:41		excepting the South one half what	
29:44		remains after the three exceptions is	
29:46		simply a portion of the Northeast	
29:48		quarter of section six now shown in	
29:51		relation to the river and ranch the	
29:53		North line of the east one eighth would	
29:55		in theory measure six hundred and sixty	
29:58		feet next our party chief measures a	
30:02		distance of seven hundred and ten point	
30:04		five feet from the tree bridge line to	
30:07		the northeast section corner it is now	
30:10		distinctly possible that Parker did not	
30:13		receive all that Cassidy intended to	
30:15		convey to him Cassidy may still retain	
30:19		title to that portion of section six	
30:21		between the tree bridge line and the	
30:24		West line of the East one eighth a gap	
30:26		about 50 feet wide to confirm this gap	
30:31		the true breadth of the east one eighth	
30:33		of the section needs to be determined	
30:36		losing sleep over the matter our	
30:38		tenacious crew decides to recover the	
30:41		entire North line of Section six after	
30:44		considerable effort because the terrain	
30:47		is nasty	
30:48		they eventually come up with the	
30:49		northwest corner of the section well	
30:52		almost	
30:53		what they actually find our two original	
30:56		bearing trees both still standing they	
30:59		find an oak with its blaze still intact	
31:01		and a dead Sycamore near a stream each	
31:05		of these witnessed the original position	
31:07		of the 1915 closing corner which was	
31:10		originally a brass cap in a four-foot	
31:13		diameter stone mound the brass cap is	
31:16		gone and so is the mound but this corner	
31:20		is only partially lost the accessory	
31:22		bearing trees are defined as an integral	
31:25		part of the original monument enabling	
31:28		the closing corner position to be	
31:30		established from the bearing and	
31:31		distance ties provided in the 1915 field	
31:34		notes shown in the graphic like its	
31:38		northeast counterpart this corner of	
31:40		section 6 is defined as a closing corner	
31:43		because it is subordinate to the	
31:45		standard parallel it controls the	
31:48		direction of the west line of the	
31:49		section but not its northerly terminus	
31:54		supposing that the closing corner at the	
31:57		northwest corner of the section is as	
31:59		close to the standard parallel as was	
32:02		the closing corner at the northeast	
32:04		corner of the section the measured	
32:06		distance between the two closing corners	
32:08		will give the crew enough information to	
32:10		set up an approximate East 1/8 of the	
32:13		section true yes no maybe the subject of	
32:25		land surveying is full of options and	
32:27		possibilities whether the answer is true	
32:30		or false or something in between is	
32:32		embodied in the legal definition of the	
32:35		east one-eighth of the section certainly	
32:38		we can divide the measured distance by	
32:40		eight but does the result give us the	
32:43		legal definition of the east one-eighth	
32:46		also we have to deal with the fact that	
32:48		we are working in Section six	
32:50		everybody's favorite section a typical	
32:54		section six whether it abuts a standard	
32:57		parallel or not is subdivided on the	
33:00		government plat into Lots	
33:01		each lot being given a numbered	
33:03		designation these Lots were never	
33:07		expected to contain exactly forty acres	
33:10		because they include the excess or	
33:12		deficiency of land in laying out the	
33:14		township the government plat will show	
33:17		acreages for these Lots based upon the	
33:19		field measurements of the original	
33:21		surveyors as they closed in to the north	
33:23		and west lines of the township these	
33:28		closing measurements constitute the	
33:30		fractional parts of the section the	
33:32		acreage is we see on the plat to day	
33:34		were originally computed from these	
33:37		fractional parts typically lot one might	
33:41		contain forty two point one acres lakh	
33:44		to forty four point six acres and so on	
33:46		to derive the side dimensions a reverse	
33:49		calculation must be done starting with	
33:52		the areas in this case all of this boils	
33:57		down to saying that the north quarter	
33:59		corner should be established at forty	
34:01		chains proportional to the overall	
34:03		length of the section line so what does	
34:07		all of this neat section six stuff have	
34:09		to do with the east one-eighth of the	
34:10		section nothing probably to understand	
34:14		this we need to know how to define the	
34:17		terms of this legal description and for	
34:20		that we need to know whether to apply	
34:22		the distinction between subdividing	
34:24		sections under rules set by the federal	
34:27		manuals or use the criteria of	
34:30		subdivisions under state law	
34:33		this is a complicated area of boundary	
34:36		determination often subject to legal	
34:38		opinion and speculation suffice it to	
34:41		say that most situations will be covered	
34:44		by the general viewpoint that for	
34:46		government patents containing	
34:48		descriptions of lot one lot - or 1/16	
34:52		portions in larger such as the Northeast	
34:55		quarter of the Northeast quarter and the	
34:58		south half the original government plat	
35:01		controls the proportioning of side	
35:03		dimensions to create adequate parts 1/8	
35:08		corners are not unheard of as government	
35:11		monuments however since there is	
35:13		probably no east 1/8 of a section to be	
35:16		found in the context of government plots	
35:18		such a portion might be considered a	
35:21		subdivision under state law if that is	
35:24		the case the description east 1/8 under	
35:27		california law would probably refer to	
35:30		an area rather than an eloquent part to	
35:35		be absolutely sure of oddly described	
35:37		section designations never hesitate to	
35:40		search back to the original patent deeds	
35:42		that conveyed the land from the federal	
35:44		government actually in our section 6	
35:47		situation the federal government deeded	
35:50		the entire section as a whole in 1875 to	
35:53		a railroad the term east 1/8 was	
35:57		invented by private parties later in the	
36:02		final analysis our patient field crew	
36:04		does not need to know the precise extent	
36:06		of the east 1/8 however they should pay	
36:10		attention to the possible theoretical	
36:12		overlap of Parker's subdivision into	
36:15		Cassidy's original land this raises the	
36:18		question as to the ownership of the	
36:21		overlap a subdivide er cannot convey	
36:24		land he does not own none of the	
36:28		property within this 50-foot overlap or	
36:31		gap depending upon your point of view	
36:33		was actually subdivided or conveyed with	
36:37		the filing of the subdivision map the	
36:39		strip remains in the estate of cassidy	
36:41		long-dead and only his heirs or	
36:44		successors may pass	
36:45		now to this area this does not mean that	
36:49		unwritten means of title transfer have	
36:51		not taken effect but only the courts can	
36:55		say for sure the subdivision lines four	
36:59		Lots three and four that run west to	
37:01		east should be terminated at the east	
37:03		line of Parker's original ownership	
37:05		defined by the tree bridge line the crew	
37:13		is finally ready to lay out the land	
37:15		described in the Sundance Ranch	
37:17		partnership Dean refreshing our memories	
37:20		that deed describes the north easterly	
37:23		twelve hundred and fifty feet of	
37:24		Parker's land excepting the North seven	
37:27		hundred feet and the east six hundred	
37:30		and sixty feet as you might recall the	
37:33		wording in that deed ended with the	
37:35		extra phrase containing an area of eight	
37:39		point four five acres drawing his	
37:43		calculator from its holster the party	
37:46		chief assumes roughly perpendicular	
37:47		sides for the ranch and proceeds to take	
37:50		the product of the sides five hundred	
37:53		and fifty feet and five hundred and	
37:54		ninety feet this yields an area of seven	
37:58		point four or five acres exactly one	
38:00		acre less than stated in the deed a	
38:03		typographical error our party chief	
38:05		surmises or is it mistakes and surveying	
38:11		work if located with certainty should be	
38:14		corrected at the place of their	
38:15		occurrence so they do not adversely	
38:17		influence other portions of the work but	
38:21		where is the mistake is it the acreage	
38:25		or one of the footages the party chief	
38:29		now considers the fact that the footages	
38:31		are given as whole numbers whereas the	
38:34		acreage appears to be the result	
38:35		erroneous or not of a calculation based	
38:39		upon the footages a general intent	
38:42		yields to a particular intent if there	
38:45		is inconsistency between them if we	
38:49		accept the footages as the particular	
38:51		terms because they are stated as whole	
38:54		numbers then the area quoted might	
38:56		become the general term because	
38:58		it is derived from computation finally	
39:02		the party chief may settle on what is	
39:04		the most definitive possibility calls	
39:07		for area unless expressly intended are	
39:11		the least important element when	
39:13		considering conflicting elements in a	
39:15		description lacking a clearly stated	
39:18		intention the general problem faced by	
39:21		the surveyor is to decide if there are	
39:23		other possibilities hidden in the	
39:25		wording of descriptions an acceptable	
39:28		solution can be supported by any number	
39:30		of existing facts but may be refuted by	
39:33		only one a surveyors liability may be	
39:36		avoided by eliminating all possibilities	
39:39		that refute a solution our party chief	
39:43		considers the area called out in the	
39:45		deed to be soundly refuted excepting the	
39:49		footages as the proper terms of the	
39:51		Sundance ranch partnership deed he	
39:54		realizes he is now in a position to	
39:56		search for the corners while he muses	
40:01		over this his chain Minh reminds him	
40:03		that nothing was recovered during the	
40:05		earlier cursory search for monuments	
40:07		within the subdivision he suggests that	
40:10		Parker's deed which probably corresponds	
40:12		to the boundary of the subdivision might	
40:15		be retraced and searched for original	
40:18		subdivision corners on its boundary then	
40:21		the chain Minh suggests that from these	
40:24		corners on the boundary the corners	
40:27		inside the subdivision might be found	
40:31		this reasoning convinces the party chief	
40:34		to run out the rest of Parker's Dee	
40:37		unfortunately as we will all realize	
40:40		later this reasoning should have been	
40:42		considered more carefully before we	
40:45		fully explore the dastardly deed of	
40:48		Parker let's take a break I'll resume	
40:51		the saga of the Sundance Ranch after	
40:53		these important words from our sponsor	
41:03		welcome back to monument valley where	
41:06		the perils of boundary retracement	
41:08		lurked in every corner as our story	
41:11		continues we find our noteworthy crew at	
41:14		a point in the park erdene along the	
41:16		tree bridge line 1,700 feet subtly from	
41:20		the north line of section 6 this is the	
41:24		end of the first leg of the parker deed	
41:27		the graphic will refresh our memory and	
41:30		help us reorient to the parker	
41:31		description from here	
41:35		Parker's deed turns to the west on a new	
41:38		heading reading from Parker's deed the	
41:41		next instruction is vents south 89 30	
41:45		west 660 feet as displayed in the	
41:52		graphic the description is in route to a	
41:54		certain gauging station to our party	
41:58		chief getting there appears to be	
41:59		straightforward once he gets pointed in	
42:01		the right direction	
42:02		and what is the right direction this is	
42:06		the first mention of a bearing in	
42:08		Parker's description although the word	
42:10		southerly was used earlier along the	
42:13		tree bridge line this term is too	
42:15		general to properly orient the deed the	
42:19		chain person notices something	
42:20		interesting however here is what she	
42:24		discovers the subdivision map partially	
42:28		shown indicates the bearing north	
42:30		:30 west for its east line further we	
42:35		recall that the lines of the subdivision	
42:37		bear at right angles to each other and	
42:40		since the present course of Parker's	
42:42		deed runs along a bearing of South 89 30	
42:46		west this puts us exactly at right	
42:50		angles to the subdivision map a	
42:53		brilliant piece of detective work the	
42:55		chain person has found a bearing	
42:58		correlation between Parker's subdivision	
43:00		map and his deed with this correlation	
43:05		why can't we assume that the basis of	
43:08		bearing in Parker's deed was meant to be	
43:11		his East line as shown on his	
43:13		subdivision map	
43:14		or vice-versa bearing in mind the	
43:17		subdivision map was recorded 15 years	
43:20		after his deed to answer this we must	
43:24		remind ourselves of the fundamental	
43:26		premise of deed interpretation that the	
43:29		language of a deed is controlled by its	
43:31		written terms in all terms of the deed	
43:33		are assumed to be present if Parker's	
43:38		description had called out the bearing	
43:40		shown on his subdivision map for the	
43:42		tree bridge line we would base the	
43:44		consecutive courses upon that bearing	
43:46		and this would preserve a right angle	
43:49		where the deed turns to the west but we	
43:53		are always required to base the bearings	
43:55		upon the first course where a particular	
43:58		bearing is given if this first course	
44:01		falls along a monument in line its	
44:04		direction would be dictated by found	
44:06		monuments controlling the deed without	
44:09		monuments the assumed direction of the	
44:12		second course south 89 30 west is based	
44:16		upon astronomic north in the event that	
44:21		a basis of bearings is not stated or	
44:23		otherwise implied in a deed astronomic	
44:27		bearings should be assumed the field	
44:30		crew performs a solar observation to	
44:32		provide the needed basis of bearing once	
44:37		a basis of bearing has been adopted it	
44:39		applies to all courses following unless	
44:42		a new basis of bearings is stated or	
44:44		implied there for Parker's next two	
44:48		courses are based upon astronomic north	
44:50		the actual deed instructions are as	
44:53		follows	
44:55		Vence south 0 30 East 300 feet Vence	
45:01		South 89 30 West 900 feet to Logan's	
45:06		gauging station the phrase to Logan's	
45:10		gauging station begins with one of the	
45:13		most important words in land surveying	
45:15		it's a little word but it demands a lot	
45:18		to requires that both the bearing and	
45:21		the distance given beforehand in this	
45:24		case South 89th 30 West 900 feet	
45:28		yield to the object described in a deed	
45:33		objects called out are the same as	
45:35		monuments monuments whether they are	
45:38		natural objects or artificial ones such	
45:40		as iron pipes always take precedence	
45:43		over mathematical information therefore	
45:47		the cruise next pursuit will be defined	
45:49		the gauging station when they find it	
45:52		the center of the station will be taken	
45:55		as the deep position since no other	
45:57		intent is specified in the wording their	
46:01		ground search reveals suspect remains a	
46:04		cylindrical shaft suspended in the air	
46:07		supported by a set of metal brackets	
46:09		affixed to a large rock in the clip	
46:13		shown in part is Baltimore's plat drawn	
46:17		in 1905 the same year as Parker's deed	
46:20		showing a tie to a gauging station in	
46:23		existence at that time Baltimore does	
46:27		not refer to it as Logan's gauging	
46:29		station as stated in Parker's deed is	
46:34		Baltimore's ankle tie	
46:36		sufficient to relocate the gauging	
46:37		station he shows on his map remember	
46:41		that an obliterated corner may be	
46:43		reestablished using an acceptable map or	
46:46		plat if it depicts and indicates by	
46:49		measurement the original location of the	
46:52		corner there is no apparent reason to	
46:56		reject Baltimore's plat as an acceptable	
46:58		map although this does not mean it	
47:01		should not be heavily scrutinized all	
47:04		maps and records even if they are modern	
47:07		and seem reliable should be thoroughly	
47:09		examined in all parts a sources	
47:13		reliability and a surveyors liability	
47:16		are forever interlocked noting these	
47:21		warnings our party chief decides to tie	
47:23		the cylindrical shaft held by the metal	
47:26		braces and compare this position to the	
47:28		right angle tie shown on Baltimore's map	
47:32		his measurement corroborates Baltimore's	
47:35		tie line to within two feet evidently	
47:38		Baltimore's gauging station coincides	
47:40		with	
47:41		remains are these remains then the same	
47:45		as Logan's gauging station described in	
47:48		Parker's deed it is possible to	
47:52		corroborate this further by computing	
47:55		the position of the station itself using	
47:57		the course information contained in the	
47:59		parker description itself when this is	
48:04		done a 45-foot discrepancy results in	
48:06		this case it would be a good idea to	
48:10		solicit testimony from area residents	
48:11		that the cliff remains are indeed those	
48:14		of a unique gauging station that existed	
48:18		in this area of the river around 1905	
48:23		unlike the earlier principle that	
48:25		refuted Baltimore's monument on the	
48:27		bridge because it was not called for in	
48:30		the description here there exists no	
48:33		boundary principle based upon the	
48:35		available evidence that requires the	
48:38		cliff remains to be refuted as the	
48:40		gauging station backed into this corner	
48:43		the party chief cannot escape a dilemma	
48:46		are these the remains of the station or	
48:49		aren't they the jury inside his head	
48:54		takes a few moments to deliberate he	
48:58		accepts Baltimore's plat as	
49:00		corroborating evidence for the	
49:02		obliterated gauging station he accepts	
49:05		the visible remains as primary evidence	
49:08		he can find none of the area residents	
49:12		to assert otherwise the next course of	
49:16		the Parker deed is not as easy to	
49:18		retrace it reads vents along the top of	
49:25		the left bank of the river north 46:30	
49:29		west 200 feet in the graphic shown this	
49:34		course is seen leaving the gauging	
49:36		station coming to an angle point which	
49:39		then turns the Parker boundary to the	
49:41		west moving to the next graphic we see a	
49:45		detail of the area near the terminus of	
49:48		this course here the chain Minh finds	
49:51		the tail end of a retaining wall	
49:53		overlooking the river	
49:54		the wall bears to date 1935 scribed on	
49:59		its top next to the date is a brass plug	
50:02		set in concrete bearing the stamp city	
50:05		engineer the crew suspects that the wall	
50:10		is a public works project and where	
50:12		there are public works there are public	
50:15		survey notes the chain person is	
50:18		dispatched to the country store where	
50:20		she begins a telephone search for more	
50:22		information during her research the	
50:26		chain Minh who has remained at the site	
50:29		discovers three more monuments near the	
50:32		city engineers disk a three-quarter inch	
50:35		iron pipe with a brass disk that is	
50:38		partially obscured an open two inch iron	
50:42		pipe and a two by two wooden stake	
50:47		examining the subdivision map in the	
50:50		vicinity of this point the chief notes	
50:53		that a two by two redwood stake was	
50:56		originally set here for the subdivision	
50:59		his first guess is that this found two	
51:02		by two stake is the original he	
51:05		carefully removes the stake from the	
51:07		ground replacing it with a nail to hold	
51:09		its position inspecting the stake	
51:12		carefully he notes it's deteriorated	
51:15		condition at that moment the chain	
51:18		person returns with a map from the city	
51:20		engineer's office which was sent via the	
51:22		general stores fax machine isn't	
51:25		technology wonderful a detail of the	
51:29		city engineer's map shows clearly the	
51:32		replacement of the original subdivision	
51:34		corner drawn by the city engineer there	
51:37		appears to be little to dispute except	
51:39		for the other monuments so what do we	
51:44		have one a city engineers disk thought	
51:48		to be the replacement of an original	
51:49		subdivision monument but in conflict	
51:52		with to a redwood stake suggestive of	
51:56		being very old together with three an	
52:00		open two inch iron pipe that for all we	
52:03		know might be a sleeve to hold a real	
52:06		estate sign	
52:07		and for a 3/4 inch iron pipe set by an	
52:11		unknown engineer the situation of	
52:14		multiple monuments is a fairly common	
52:16		occurrence conflicts between monuments	
52:20		should be resolved by using the one that	
52:22		best satisfies written intents and or	
52:26		can best be linked with the original	
52:28		using corroborated evidence in the	
52:32		absence of identifiable original corners	
52:35		corners such as those in the present	
52:37		story are near the bottom of the list as	
52:39		acceptable controlling evidence what is	
52:42		the least acceptable evidence that	
52:45		evidence left by improvements built soon	
52:48		after the original monumentation what do	
52:53		we do if by these standards two	
52:55		monuments have equal credentials as a	
52:58		corner the monument and best agreement	
53:01		with record angle distance or area	
53:04		should be used when deciding between	
53:06		conflicting monuments of otherwise equal	
53:09		status however this is not a case of	
53:13		choosing between monuments in a	
53:14		subdivision what is being retraced is	
53:18		Parker's deed not the subdivision	
53:21		although the two appear to represent the	
53:24		same piece of land one cannot be used to	
53:28		reestablish the other why because a	
53:32		subdivision creates lots that are	
53:34		conveyed by action of a survey defined	
53:36		by monuments subdivision monuments are	
53:39		set to subdivide a piece of land within	
53:42		and ownership they do not control the	
53:45		original conveyance that created the	
53:47		land being subdivided although the city	
53:52		engineer's disk might be used to control	
53:54		this particular corner of the	
53:56		subdivision where do we place the	
53:59		corresponding corner of the park or deed	
54:02		we are permitted to use the written	
54:04		terms of the deed only therefore	
54:09		following the deed literally the party	
54:11		chief calculates a traverse from the	
54:14		remains of the gauging station along the	
54:16		course north 4630 west 200 feet	
54:21		using the basis of bearing established	
54:23		by the solar observation he finds this	
54:26		position on the ground and compares it	
54:28		to the four monuments in question	
54:32		unfortunately the point falls short of	
54:35		the wall and into the river we note that	
54:38		the point does not fall on the quote top	
54:41		of the left bank of the river unquote as	
54:43		stated in the Parker deed are we bound	
54:47		to the top of the bank as a natural	
54:49		monument called for would this lead us	
54:52		to consider one of the other points as	
54:54		better evidence the bank of the river is	
54:58		presumed to be ephemeral subject to	
55:01		alteration by floodwaters and erosion	
55:03		if the sudden loss of part of the bank	
55:06		known as avulsion were to occur it would	
55:10		not constitute a change in the original	
55:13		deed boundary and avulsion does not	
55:15		change boundaries local residents and	
55:21		records in the County Historical Society	
55:23		Museum confirm that floods occurring in	
55:26		910 wreaked havoc on the banks of the	
55:29		river and that the retaining wall built	
55:31		in 1935 was the last of a series of	
55:34		public works designed to bring the river	
55:36		under control therefore the bearing and	
55:40		the distance from the gauging station	
55:42		remains the best evidence of the	
55:44		location of the bank of the river before	
55:46		the flood let's continue now with	
55:50		Parker's next course we go thence south	
55:55		9 30 west to the cliff road that's	
56:00		along the cliff road I need to interrupt	
56:03		the description here in mid-sentence	
56:05		just for a moment these courses bring	
56:08		our field surveyors to and along the	
56:11		cliff road the bearings continue to be	
56:14		astronomic this part of the river is	
56:17		characterized by a deep 100-foot chasm	
56:20		through solid rock the road runs along	
56:23		the top of the cliff and is clearly the	
56:26		only road that has ever existed along	
56:28		the cliff in the absence of modifiers to	
56:32		clarify the intent such as	
56:35		the first edge of the road and so on we	
56:38		must use the center of the road bid for	
56:40		the deed line the road may or may not	
56:43		turn abruptly as indicated by the map	
56:46		although the map may depict the road it	
56:49		only serves to clarify it is not part of	
56:53		the legal description the true shape of	
56:55		Parker's boundary would include any	
56:57		curves in the roads alignment the	
57:02		wording along the cliff road which was	
57:05		interrupted just a moment ago continues	
57:07		now with a very important qualifying	
57:10		phrase which reads as follows to the	
57:15		west line of the easterly 400 feet of	
57:18		the west half of section 6 being the	
57:21		southeast corner of land conveyed to be	
57:24		Ketchum by deed in the year 1900 this is	
57:31		a double call citing both the land of a	
57:33		certain Ketchum and the easterly 400	
57:36		feet of the west half of the section	
57:39		this sets the stage for possible	
57:41		conflicting terms the call to Kachins	
57:45		land implies that it's East line should	
57:47		be the rest line of the easterly 400	
57:50		feet and that's fine providing it does	
57:53		our party chief should verify this	
57:56		before proceeding and should not be	
57:59		surprised to find Ketchum's land	
58:00		described differently within the section	
58:04		until we know more	
58:05		Kachins land may or may not enjoy senior	
58:08		rights	
58:10		senior rights are those rights held by	
58:13		land owners who obtain title earlier	
58:16		than an adjoining party the adjourn or	
58:19		yielding to the senior title as of the	
58:22		junior rights between a joiners the	
58:25		senior deed is usually the one recorded	
58:27		first but the date of record ation is	
58:30		not the only factor used to establish	
58:33		senior rights the date of agreement as	
58:38		well as the date of execution may come	
58:40		under close inspection by title	
58:42		companies or the court between any two	
58:46		adjoining there is always a senior	
58:49		and junior title except for simultaneous	
58:51		conveniences in which case there is no	
58:54		distinction forever on his toes the	
58:59		party chief inspects ketchem steed and	
59:01		finds that Ketchum's Dean actually abuts	
59:04		the West line of the easterly 3040 feet	
59:08		of the section	
59:10		therefore Ketchum's East line depends	
59:13		upon the East line of the section not	
59:16		the north-south centerline as stated in	
59:19		Parker's description however there is	
59:22		always the possibility that Ketchum's	
59:24		description is incorrect a call to an	
59:27		adjoint does not necessarily indicate	
59:30		senior writes a chain of title obtained	
59:33		from a title company is necessary to	
59:36		determine junior/senior rights if the	
59:39		legal description in Ketchum's deed were	
59:42		to hold up as senior in the title search	
59:44		it will become necessary to survey the	
59:47		east line of section 6 to retrace	
59:49		Parker's bead for the time being	
59:52		Ketchum's East line will need to remain	
59:54		uncertain we do not have enough	
59:57		information about the east line of the	
59:59		section at this time the crew continues	
60:02		with the next instruction in Parker's	
60:05		deed which tells them to go thence	
60:09		northerly along Ketchum's east line to	
60:12		highway 10	
60:14		they follow an old north-south fence	
60:17		until it intersects the highway	
60:20		right-of-way fence a specific point on	
60:23		or in the highway to go to is not	
60:25		expressed in this wording do we stop at	
60:28		the side line or proceed to the center	
60:30		line of the road to name two	
60:32		possibilities the chain Minh combs	
60:36		through the research package to find an	
60:38		early highway document recorded in 1880	
60:41		and easement to the county for highway	
60:44		purposes along a certain highway 10	
60:47		granted by the original landowner of all	
60:50		of section 6 the flyer railroad company	
60:53		calls to a road are to the centerline if	
60:57		the Grand Tour owns the underlying fee	
60:59		in the row	
61:00		unless the road itself is specifically	
61:03		excluded the term highway 10 is also	
61:07		potentially ambiguous checking his	
61:10		research package for other highway	
61:12		alignments that might have been granted	
61:14		or dedicated since the 1880 document the	
61:17		party chief confirms for himself that	
61:20		modern highway 10 wasn't created by deed	
61:23		until 1930 and is therefore not relevant	
61:26		to Parker's description	
61:29		unfortunately the 1880 easement document	
61:32		did not specify with or a mathematical	
61:35		position for the highway for the sake of	
61:38		a good story which of course this one is	
61:42		let's pretend that neither a map nor	
61:45		description exists for that old highway	
61:48		then it becomes useless to belabor the	
61:51		question where is the 1880 highway it is	
61:55		possible that it is lost forever every	
61:58		once in a while a road will fall through	
62:00		the cracks not everything in the world	
62:03		is retraceable	
62:10		proceeding with Parker's description	
62:12		however uncertain it may be in places it	
62:15		next instructs the crew to go thence	
62:18		along said Highway ten to the	
62:21		north-south centerline of section six	
62:24		they are brought to a line they have up	
62:27		to now been able to avoid to determine	
62:31		the location of the north-south	
62:33		centerline of section six they will need	
62:36		to establish the north and south quarter	
62:38		corners of the section I talked earlier	
62:42		about how to establish the north quarter	
62:44		corner which is the northwest corner of	
62:46		lot to the south quarter corner if	
62:51		intact is the other point the crew needs	
62:53		if it is gone their search will need to	
62:57		branch out to the section corners west	
62:59		and east of it unfortunately they cannot	
63:03		find the south quarter corner after a	
63:04		diligent search the chain Minh hikes off	
63:08		to the east to look for the southeast	
63:10		section corner finding a 19-15 brass cap	
63:13		there meanwhile the chain person	
63:16		explores the line to the west finding	
63:18		another 1915 brass cap on the Range Line	
63:22		from a single control point the party	
63:25		chief can tie both of these section	
63:27		corners as well as reset the south	
63:29		quarter corner at its proportional	
63:31		position along the 19:15 line suddenly	
63:35		it's everybody's lucky day in land	
63:39		surveying one gradually learns to	
63:42		suspect that which comes too easily	
63:44		the chief rarely inspects the 1915 usgo	
63:49		lope lat	
63:50		showing the south line of section 6	
63:54		standard brass caps were set at each of	
63:57		the corners however the situation at the	
64:00		southeast corner is a little strange a	
64:02		set stone and a stone mound was found	
64:05		there in 1915 and perpetuated with a	
64:08		brass cap	
64:09		showing that some original monumentation	
64:12		from the original 1870 survey was found	
64:15		along the South line perhaps a diligent	
64:18		search will turn up something that the	
64:20		915 survey miss	
64:23		the original field notes for this South	
64:25		line of section six describe what was	
64:28		set the southwest corner a wood stake in	
64:34		an earth Mound would be expected to lose	
64:36		favor with the elements rather quickly	
64:39		the southeast corner a set stone which	
64:42		at that time was adjacent to a tree	
64:44		would also need very good luck to	
64:46		survive fortunately it was found in 1915	
64:50		and perpetuated the south quarter corner	
64:54		holds more promise the notes call for a	
64:56		sizeable stone with a mound as well the	
65:00		915 USDA low dependent survey of	
65:04		section 6 was ordered by the government	
65:07		to quote follow in the footsteps unquote	
65:10		of the 1870 survey not to supersede it	
65:15		it occurs to our party chief that just	
65:19		because the 1915 survey failed to	
65:21		recover two out of three of the original	
65:24		870 monuments it is not necessarily	
65:27		true that those original monuments are	
65:30		gone from the face of the earth while	
65:34		the other crew members watched he scours	
65:37		a badly Boulder Mountain heavy with	
65:39		brush for evidence of the original 1870	
65:42		south quarter corner and sure enough	
65:45		discovers two possible candidates one a	
65:49		circular ring of stones half embedded in	
65:51		the earth with a 19 by 12 by 11 inch	
65:55		stone lying five feet downhill the other	
65:58		a three-foot diameter two foot high pile	
66:01		of rocks with an iron stake driven into	
66:04		the ground through its center these are	
66:07		some fifty feet apart he picks through	
66:11		the mounds carefully looking for	
66:13		possible accessory evidence in land	
66:17		surveying we leave no stone unturned it	
66:21		dawns on the chain man and he passes his	
66:23		idea along to his chief of party that	
66:26		they might test these corners by	
66:28		comparing them with topographic calls	
66:30		contained in the original 1870 notes if	
66:34		any	
66:35		it turns out that the 1870 notes do	
66:39		contain distance measurements to	
66:41		topography east and west of the subject	
66:43		quarter corner as detailed in the notes	
66:46		the 1870 government surveyors surveying	
66:50		from east to west started at the	
66:52		southeast section corner encountered a	
66:54		ridge at 30 chains very Northwest at 50	
66:58		Jaynes they encountered a stream these	
67:01		are too easily recognized landforms	
67:05		using the found corners of the 1915	
67:08		survey as an approximate guide for the	
67:11		original 1870 line the crew finds the	
67:14		ridge and stream to lie at distances	
67:17		which fit the 1870 survey notes very	
67:19		well within 10 or 20 feet the exact	
67:24		positions for the ridge and stream are	
67:26		difficult to locate this is typical of	
67:28		topographic calls measurements are at	
67:31		best within five or ten feet using the	
67:35		topographic calls the crew can place the	
67:38		quarter corner at the proper	
67:40		proportional distance between the rocky	
67:42		ridge and the stream for the south line	
67:46		of a typical Section six the quarter	
67:49		corner would be placed at 40 chains in	
67:51		this case the midpoint of the rocky	
67:54		ridge and stream the principle facts	
67:58		favoring the northwesterly circular ring	
68:00		of stones as the original 1870 quarter	
68:03		corner is the proximity of the 19 by 12	
68:06		by 11 inch stone to the circular ring	
68:09		and its position near the midline of the	
68:11		ridge and stream however this latter	
68:16		condition of position need not be met	
68:20		from the source restoration of lost or	
68:23		obliterated corners we have the	
68:26		following fundamental dictate for	
68:28		sectionalized land surveys the original	
68:31		township section and quarter section	
68:34		corners but not closing corners must	
68:37		stand as the true corners which they	
68:39		were intended to represent whether in	
68:42		the place shown by the field notes or	
68:44		not	
68:45		in addition to this we need a way to	
68:49		positively identify a corner a corners	
68:53		acceptability	
68:53		in the absence of other evidence can be	
68:56		based upon its likeness to the original	
68:58		corner the manual of instructions states	
69:01		three conditions one the character and	
69:04		dimensions of the monument in evidence	
69:07		should not be widely different from the	
69:09		record and two the markings in evidence	
69:13		should not be inconsistent with the	
69:15		record and three the nature of the	
69:18		accessories in evidence including size	
69:21		position and markings should not be	
69:24		greatly at variance with the record and	
69:27		what if there were no topographic calls	
69:30		and no mounds of stone in the absence of	
69:34		all other evidence the re-establishment	
69:37		of lost government corners must be done	
69:40		by a mathematical method of	
69:42		proportionate measure a lost corner is	
69:46		restored according to the type of corner	
69:48		it is that is standard section corner	
69:51		quarter corner closing corner township	
69:54		corner township corner on a curve	
69:57		parallel beyonder corner and so on the	
70:02		field notes govern the actual procedure	
70:05		by which a lost corner must be replaced	
70:07		and some of the procedures are not	
70:10		always obvious such as three-way	
70:12		positioning or reestablishing section	
70:15		lines with angle points failure to	
70:18		consult the notes when restoring a lost	
70:21		corner by mathematical methods is risky	
70:24		business on the exam expect unusual	
70:28		tricky circumstances like meander	
70:30		corners and closing corners on rancha	
70:32		lines remember that an obliterated	
70:36		corner is never reestablished by a	
70:38		mathematical proportion only a lost	
70:41		corner is a thorough surveyor will	
70:44		exhaust every possibility that a lost	
70:47		corner is not actually an obliterated	
70:50		corner using proportionate measure to	
70:53		re-establish an original corner should	
70:56		be done only as a last resort	
70:59		it should be stressed that the use of	
71:02		topography requires very careful	
71:04		consideration when used with the method	
71:07		of proportionate measure topography may	
71:10		not be conclusive in situations where	
71:12		the degree of measurement certainty is	
71:14		poor where topography calls proved	
71:17		inconclusive proportionate measure must	
71:20		be used in a case like this a surveyor	
71:27		should consult with the BLM but for now	
71:29		we will accept the quarter cornerstone	
71:31		backed up by the topo evidence let's	
71:35		finish out the last two courses of	
71:37		Parker's description Vence northerly	
71:40		along said north-south centerline to the	
71:43		North quarter corner of section 6 thence	
71:46		easterly to the true pointed beginning	
71:50		having completed a full retracement of	
71:53		Parker's D our weary crew is	
71:55		disappointed that little evidence	
71:57		concerning the boundary of the	
71:59		subdivision has turned up there is scant	
72:03		to go by to establish the interior	
72:05		corners reconstruction of the interior	
72:08		monuments of a subdivision from its	
72:10		boundary monuments may not be an	
72:12		effective strategy particularly in older	
72:15		subdivisions subdivision corners should	
72:18		be re-established from the closest	
72:20		available monuments inside the	
72:22		subdivision original interior monuments	
72:26		will hold in all situations whereas	
72:29		original monuments on the boundary are	
72:31		subject to the effects of title	
72:33		discrepancy finally reminding himself	
72:37		that a correct survey of the sundance	
72:40		ranch partnership deed depends solely on	
72:43		the north and east lines of Parker's	
72:45		deed the party chief decides to see	
72:47		where these corners fall inside the	
72:50		subdivision	
72:56		recalling that great overlap which had	
72:59		formed against the East line of the	
73:01		subdivision our party chief suspects	
73:04		that this overlap likewise	
73:06		shifts the deeded location of the	
73:08		Sundance ranch as owned by the	
73:10		partnership 50 feet to the west relative	
73:13		to where it is shown on the subdivision	
73:16		map he confirms this by computing the	
73:20		corners of the sundance ranch	
73:21		partnership deed and placing temporary	
73:24		ground nails	
73:25		these nails fall in the 60-foot Road	
73:28		west of the ranch nearly to the east	
73:31		line of law 8 at the same time this	
73:37		shift opens a 50-foot fissure	
73:39		on the other side who owns the land	
73:42		within this easterly gap subdivision lot	
73:47		lines are not extended beyond the	
73:49		original monuments in cases where the	
73:51		original sub divider failed to subdivide	
73:53		all his land title to the unsub divided	
73:57		land is in the original sub divider the	
74:01		land is probably still in the estate of	
74:04		Parker who owns the land within the	
74:08		overlap on the west side this falls in a	
74:11		dedicated Street the land in this street	
74:15		was not in the original title of the sub	
74:17		divider therefore it cannot be conveyed	
74:20		by virtue of the monumentation	
74:21		of the subdivision consequently only the	
74:25		West 10 feet of the 60-foot Road was	
74:28		actually created by the subdivision map	
74:32		this does not mean that the owners of	
74:35		the subdivision Lots would be forbidden	
74:37		to use this road as they may have an	
74:40		unwritten right in the road remember	
74:43		always that the rules of unwritten title	
74:46		may apply upon examination by the court	
74:50		the apparent shift in location of the	
74:53		ranch property in relation to the	
74:56		monument a tranche per the subdivision	
74:58		should not deter our crew from	
75:00		continuing their search for original	
75:02		subdivision monuments they need the	
75:05		subdivision monuments to define the	
75:08		access	
75:09		Road to the Sundance ranch as our crew	
75:12		searches for the original monumentation	
75:15		we'll keep track of their progress by	
75:17		looking at graphics based upon the	
75:20		subdivision map keep in mind that the	
75:23		actual location of the ranch is shifted	
75:25		0 feet to the west of its position on	
75:28		the maps we are viewing with a measure	
75:33		of luck the crew stumbles upon an old	
75:35		redwood hub at the apparent northwest	
75:38		corner of the Sundance ranch as shown on	
75:41		the subdivision map and finding an axle	
75:45		near the northeast corner of the ranch	
75:47		things begin to fall into place the	
75:51		distance and direction between this car	
75:53		axle and the old redwood hub fits the	
75:56		map well the chain person succeeds in	
76:00		obtaining the help of the owners of Lots	
76:02		three and four enabling the crew to add	
76:05		to their list of found monuments another	
76:08		axle at the southwest corner of the	
76:10		ranch as well as four other original	
76:13		monuments on the boundary of Lots 3 and	
76:15		 all of which are redwood hubs except	
76:18		the northwest corner of Lot three which	
76:21		is an iron pin the owner of lot three is	
76:25		curious about the location of his	
76:27		southeast corner let's digress for a	
76:31		moment and demonstrate the specific	
76:33		manner in which the southeast corner of	
76:35		lot 3 would be reestablished	
76:37		assuming it is lost between the	
76:42		subdivision map and the field	
76:43		measurements we observe a difference of	
76:45		.5 feet in the overall length of the	
76:49		combined East lines of Lots 3 and 4 this	
76:53		difference should be distributed among	
76:55		the Lots along the line formed by the	
76:57		found monuments in accordance with the	
76:59		principle of proration excess or	
77:04		deficiency in measurement of a straight	
77:06		line between fixed monuments within a	
77:09		subdivision is distributed among all the	
77:12		Lots along the line in proportion to	
77:14		their record measurements when	
77:18		subdivision Lots are created by a map	
77:20		all the Lots are created simultaneously	
77:23		even though actual conveyances of the	
77:26		Lots may occur at different times at	
77:28		later dates there is no senior or junior	
77:30		titled distinction since no senior	
77:34		rights exist mathematical proration	
77:36		becomes the only equitable way to	
77:38		distribute excesses or deficiencies in	
77:41		measurement lot 3 therefore receives	
77:44		more of the excess due to its longer	
77:46		line excess or deficiency cannot be	
77:51		distributed beyond any original found	
77:53		monument in a subdivision for example in	
77:56		a typical block original monuments found	
77:59		at a B and C enable us to set any of the	
78:03		intermediate points between them corners	
78:06		at D and E would not qualify for	
78:08		proration based upon the monuments found	
78:12		however the monuments at a and B might	
78:15		be used to control the direction of the	
78:18		North line of the block in this way	
78:20		corners D and E may be partially	
78:23		controlled by a and B monuments set	
78:29		beyond the original title line of the	
78:31		sub dividers property can control the	
78:33		direction of lines within the	
78:35		subdivision much like government closing	
78:38		corners the direction of the South line	
78:42		of Lot three is controlled by the	
78:44		monument set for the southeast corner of	
78:46		Lot three even though the true corner	
78:48		falls on the tree bridge line therefore	
78:51		the South line of Lot three cannot go	
78:54		all the way to the apparent East line of	
78:57		the subdivision map that's 50 feet past	
79:00		the sub dividers original ownership as	
79:04		suggested by the graphic we would expect	
79:06		to find the original subdivision	
79:08		monuments set about 50 feet east of the	
79:12		tree bridge line but life is full of	
79:15		things we least expect returning to the	
79:20		progress of our surveyors their	
79:22		measurements show that the subdivision	
79:24		was in fact monument at only one point	
79:27		five feet east of the tree bridge line	
79:30		not 50 feet	
79:32		the North and South lines of lots three	
79:35		and four should be 660 feet long	
79:38		according to the subdivision map these	
79:41		lots are actually about 50 feet narrower	
79:44		on the ground the party chief concludes	
79:47		that the East line of lots 3 and 4 were	
79:50		monumental	
79:52		to within about 1.5 feet anyway but the	
79:57		balance of the subdivision to the west	
79:59		was monumental 50 feet to the east	
80:03		regardless the original monuments within	
80:05		the subdivision still hold for the Lots	
80:07		they were intended to define except for	
80:10		the senior rights of the Sundance ranch	
80:12		of course the chain person notices that	
80:16		the northeast corner of lot 3 has been	
80:19		set about 4 feet past the North line of	
80:22		Parker's deed into section 31 her first	
80:27		inclination is to assume that the lot as	
80:29		a monument is cut off by the section	
80:32		line fortunately she has been studying	
80:35		diligently for the Land Surveyors exam	
80:38		and retains a number of obscure	
80:40		principles in her head she points out to	
80:43		the party chief that if Parker the	
80:45		original sub divider also on this land	
80:48		in section 31 at the time he filed his	
80:51		subdivision then he would have passed	
80:53		title through the land as monumental	
80:55		though it might have been monumental the	
81:00		chief of party disbelieving and somewhat	
81:03		ruffled takes a long slow breath and	
81:05		combs through his favorite boundary	
81:07		surveying reference where he finds that	
81:09		his chain person is indeed correct as it	
81:13		turns out Parker did own the southeast	
81:15		corner of section 31 at the time he	
81:18		filed his subdivision so lot 3 ends up	
81:23		with a projection on its North Line	
81:25		which lies 4.2 feet north of the North	
81:28		line of section 6 and a foot and a half	
81:31		past the tree bridge line meanwhile back	
81:36		at the ranch let's take a look at what	
81:38		is available for locating the 60-foot	
81:40		road access to the Sundance ranch	
81:43		remember the road is part of the survey	
81:46		the crew has been assigned to perform	
81:48		and the road is defined by the	
81:50		subdivision map the graphic shown holds	
81:54		some promise for doing this getting	
81:57		started the party chief examines the	
81:59		possibilities presented by the axle at	
82:02		the northeast corner of the ranch first	
82:06		of all he checks the overall distance	
82:08		between the northerly and southerly	
82:10		controlling monuments on the east side	
82:12		of Lots	
82:13		 and 5 and finds that it differs from	
82:16		the subdivision map by over 12 feet but	
82:19		that's not unusual for older	
82:20		subdivisions of particular interest is	
82:23		whether the axle fits a pro-rated	
82:25		position on this line before testing	
82:28		this he reminds himself that the	
82:31		position of this monument may be	
82:32		immaterial only original lines or their	
82:36		replacements can control original lines	
82:39		and subdivisions in the absence of any	
82:42		proof of occupying the same position as	
82:45		the original corner the party chief	
82:47		determines that the axle should not be	
82:50		used for proration or line direction the	
82:54		westerly lines of lots 3 and 4 in this	
82:56		case would be controlled by the two	
82:59		monuments known to be originals at the	
83:01		north and south ends assuming the	
83:05		sidelines of the 60-foot road are lost	
83:07		re-establishing the points where they	
83:09		intersect the east line of lots two and	
83:12		five would fall to the method of	
83:14		proration provided the privately-owned	
83:17		Lots bear the full brunt of the excess	
83:20		or deficiency why dedicated streets are	
83:25		in the public ownership so certain	
83:28		principles apply in the absence of	
83:31		monumentation their widths remain as	
83:34		stated on the map on the other hand	
83:37		remember that monuments always control	
83:39		the map if original Street monuments are	
83:43		recovered they will control the width of	
83:45		the street whether in agreement with the	
83:47		subdivision map or not for the situation	
83:52		at hand the factor of proration to apply	
83:55		to the east lot lines	
83:56		lots - and five requires that we first	
83:59		subtract the two 60-foot Road widths to	
84:02		leave them out of the calculation each	
84:05		of the private Lots will receive a	
84:07		proportional share of the excess or	
84:10		deficiency now for an academic question	
84:14		should the Sundance ranch which is shown	
84:17		as not a part on the subdivision map	
84:19		also receive a proportional share of the	
84:23		excess along with Lots two and five I	
84:26		will leave this brainteaser to you as a	
84:29		workbook exercise as it is with resurvey	
84:35		zuv sectionalized land proration of	
84:37		subdivision Lots is the rule of last	
84:40		resort it must always yield to the	
84:43		discovery of original monuments no	
84:47		sooner is this said that our field crew	
84:49		finds an original 2x2 redwood stake next	
84:52		to the axle this original monument	
84:56		supersedes the prorated position with	
84:59		renewed excitement the chain Minh digs	
85:01		around the southeast and southwest	
85:03		corners of the ranch at the southwest	
85:08		corner next to the earlier found axle he	
85:11		turns up the trace remains of an old	
85:13		redwood stake two feet down as more	
85:18		originals come to light	
85:19		other factors controlling the	
85:22		re-establishment of street lines begin	
85:24		to develop proration may no longer be	
85:27		tenable in instances where the	
85:29		subdivision map shows straight or	
85:31		parallel lines we also have the	
85:35		statement on the subdivision map that	
85:37		certain lines bear at right angles to	
85:39		each other	
85:41		considering these various options our	
85:43		Party chief decides to reconstruct the	
85:46		0-foot road parallel through the North	
85:49		line of the ranch as recovered by the	
85:51		original subdivision monuments found on	
85:53		that line in doing this he is asserting	
85:57		that no other monumentation exists to	
85:59		place the road this is consistent with	
86:02		the re-establishment of positions	
86:04		according to the rules of evidence as	
86:06		they apply to lost and	
86:09		corners the evidence in this case is the	
86:12		subdivision map itself the survey is not	
86:17		yet completed but the hour is growing	
86:20		late an approaching thunderstorm will	
86:23		arrive any minute	
86:24		our dogged crew packs the equipment into	
86:27		the truck the maps and deeds scattered	
86:31		everywhere	
86:31		our stacked folded in rolled and placed	
86:34		into the briefcase the chain person is	
86:37		gathering loose papers from the cab when	
86:39		she notices a small reduced Assessors	
86:42		map lying between the seats it has	
86:45		become detached from a title report	
86:48		written across lot eight is a barely	
86:51		readable reference to a record of survey	
86:55		unfortunately this record of survey is	
86:57		not contained among the research	
86:59		materials the party chief races to the	
87:03		county records center just before	
87:04		closing and there it is a complete	
87:08		survey of law date filed as a record of	
87:11		survey in 1940 at that time the entire	
87:15		boundary was recovered from original	
87:17		monuments as explained on the record of	
87:20		survey each found original was	
87:23		perpetuated with a three-quarter inch	
87:24		iron pipe with a 1/4 inch disc bearing	
87:28		the surveyors registration the crews	
87:32		work concerning the 60-foot road is of	
87:34		course superseded by this evidence with	
87:38		this map as a basis they are able to	
87:40		reestablish the 60-foot road with	
87:42		confidence the following week	
87:49		the moral of this story is that the	
87:51		harder lessons of land surveying are	
87:53		avoided by better research and	
87:55		organization put anymore immediately	
87:58		relevant way successful passage to the	
88:01		other side of the Land Surveyors exam	
88:03		will demonstrate as effectively as any	
88:06		tough survey your ability to perform	
88:08		effective analysis of evidence and to	
88:11		apply your analysis to the boundary	
88:13		problems in an efficient organized	
88:16		fashion you should not take the exam	
88:19		without thoroughly knowing the BLM	
88:21		manual and at least one of the popular	
88:24		boundary references several of which are	
88:26		noted in the reference section of the	
88:28		workbook a good rule for effective exam	
88:32		preparation is it is better to know one	
88:35		good source thoroughly so you can find	
88:38		what you're looking for quickly than to	
88:40		flounder through many you haven't had	
88:42		time to read in detail test problems	
88:46		involving boundary principles can it can	
88:48		appear quite complex on the surface only	
88:51		the poorly prepared are intimidated by	
88:54		these become thoroughly familiar with	
88:58		your research materials before you sit	
89:00		for the exam perform the many research	
89:04		needed before solving each problem each	
89:07		boundary problem is usually composed of	
89:10		a set of smaller associated problems	
89:13		pick the problem apart to expose its	
89:17		inner components I would like to	
89:19		paraphrase a surveyor of note henry	
89:22		david thoreau whose sage advice applies	
89:25		very well to the examinee when you find	
89:28		yourself laboring in the complexities of	
89:30		a test problem just remember to simplify	
89:34		simplify simplify to this I might add	
89:39		another principle that should make the	
89:41		test easy to pass the last principle of	
89:44		this lesson study study study	
90:38		you
