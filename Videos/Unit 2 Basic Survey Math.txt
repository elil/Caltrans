00:49		welcome to Caltrans lsit Els exam	
0:52		preparation course one aid in your	
0:55		preparation for California licensure	
0:57		examinations or word of caution don't	
1:01		use this course as your only preparation	
1:04		devise and follow a regular schedule of	
1:07		study which begins months before the	
1:09		test what many problems in each area not	
1:14		just those in this courses workbook but	
1:17		problems from other sources as well	
1:19		this course is funded by Caltrans but	
1:23		you and I owe a profound thanks to	
1:26		others the courses instructors from the	
1:29		academic community the private sector	
1:31		other public agencies and from Caltrans	
1:34		as well we wish you well in your study	
1:38		toward becoming a member of California's	
1:40		professional land surveying community	
1:44		welcome viewers to this unit of the	
1:47		Caltrans training videos my name is	
1:50		edward zimmerman I work at the geometry	
1:52		in the geometrics branch at Caltrans	
1:55		headquarters in Sacramento in the past I	
1:58		work for the California State Lands	
2:00		Commission a private surveying firm in	
2:03		the city of Sacramento I also teach	
2:06		surveying at Sacramento City College I	
2:09		am a licensed as a professional land	
2:13		surveyor in California and in the state	
2:15		of Arizona the subject I would like to	
2:18		discuss today is understanding and most	
2:21		importantly simplifying and working with	
2:23		basic surveying mathematics I want to	
2:27		emphasize that this video units	
2:29		objective is to present basic	
2:31		mathematical skills useful to surveyors	
2:34		the discussion will be limited and is	
2:37		not intended as a comprehensive	
2:39		presentation of all surveying math	
2:41		procedures it is taken for granted that	
2:44		most viewers are already familiar with	
2:47		some or most of the topics presented in	
2:49		the beginning of this unit an	
2:52		understanding of basic arithmetic	
2:54		algebra geometry and trigonometry	
2:57		calculation methods	
2:59		is necessary to understand the more	
3:01		complex forms of mathematics that you	
3:04		will eventually encounter in your	
3:05		surveying career hopefully this unit	
3:09		will help the surveyor in the trainee to	
3:11		develop and hone their computational	
3:13		skills and to make correct and effective	
3:16		use of appropriate solutions to	
3:19		particular survey calculation problems I	
3:22		am assuming that the viewer is	
3:24		comfortable using and performing basic	
3:26		arithmetic operations a review of the	
3:29		technical math test texts in the	
3:32		reference section of this workbook will	
3:34		provide additional help with operations	
3:36		and fundamental mathematical skills not	
3:39		covered in this video in this day and	
3:42		age electronic marvels every surveyor	
3:44		has one or several types of computers	
3:47		and calculators this video will present	
3:50		various principles of math to get the	
3:52		viewer a familiarization and a better	
3:55		understanding of the principles involved	
3:56		in solutions it is assumed that	
3:59		calculator will be used to determine	
4:01		numerical values of any given problems	
4:05		the development of the decimal system	
4:08		can be tracked back many centuries in	
4:10		ancient times a small group of objects	
4:13		were counted by comparing their number	
4:15		with a number of fingers on ones hand	
4:18		when larger groups of objects were	
4:20		counted pebbles were arranged in groups	
4:23		of 10 to keep track of the large number	
4:26		of objects being counted the modern	
4:29		counting system or decimal system is	
4:31		based on the on these early beginnings	
4:34		the whole number part of a number falls	
4:38		on the left of the decimal point and the	
4:40		fractional part of a number falls on the	
4:42		right of the decimal point the chart and	
4:45		this graphics shows the value of numbers	
4:48		both both left and right of the decimal	
4:50		point as shown numbers to the left our	
4:54		hole and follow powers of 10 while	
4:57		numbers to the right are fractional when	
5:00		adding a group of decimal numbers	
5:02		tabulate them so the decimal point of	
5:05		each number is in vertical alignment up	
5:08		down the column of numbers for example	
5:12		add 1o 2.21	
5:15		fourteen fifteen point five twenty one	
5:19		point three four eight six oh eight	
5:22		point 17 six point four one one starting	
5:28		with a column to the right total each	
5:29		column placing the decimal point of the	
5:32		total in line with a decimal point above	
5:34		when subtracting decimal numbers also	
5:37		tabulate the numbers so each decimal	
5:40		point is aligned vertically for example	
5:43		subtract one three to four point four	
5:47		six five from two one six four seven	
5:50		point nine starting with the column to	
5:54		the right subtract each number and then	
5:57		place the decimal point of the	
5:58		difference in line with the decimal	
6:00		points above it	
6:01		notice that zeros have been added to the	
6:03		minuend	
6:04		to fill out the column to multiply	
6:07		decimal numbers determine the number of	
6:10		decimal places in both the multiplier	
6:12		and the multiplicand the product will	
6:15		have the same number of decimal places	
6:16		as total places in the two factors for	
6:21		example multiply eight hundred and forty	
6:23		three point 21 by fifty six point eight	
6:26		nine three the product will be	
6:29		forty-eight thousand zero forty eight	
6:32		point six three five four three in the	
6:36		second example 0.043 is multiplied by	
6:40		zero point zero zero two one note that	
6:44		zeros must be placed between the product	
6:47		and the decimal point to create the	
6:49		correct number of decimal places long	
6:52		division of decimal numbers is set up	
6:54		and tabulated the same as whole division	
6:57		whole number division for example	
6:59		divided 2467 point eighty nine by 10.45	
7:07		move the divisors decimal point to the	
7:10		right enough places to make it a whole	
7:12		number move the decimal place in the	
7:15		dividend the same number of places to	
7:17		the right position the decimal place in	
7:20		the quotient directly above the desk	
7:21		point in the dividend you will generally	
7:24		have to add zeros to the dividend to	
7:27		attain the required numbers of decimal	
7:29		places in your answer in the surveying	
7:33		measurement process it is important to	
7:36		indicate the measurement accuracy of a	
7:38		measurement by recording the correct	
7:40		number of significant figures the number	
7:42		of significant figures in a quantity are	
7:45		defined as those digits that are certain	
7:48		or directly read plus one digit that is	
7:51		estimated and/or uncertain significant	
7:56		figures are sometimes confused with	
7:58		decimal places decimal places do not	
8:01		indicate significant figures but are	
8:03		used to maintain the correct number of	
8:05		significant figures some examples are	
8:08		being shown in this graphic in surveying	
8:11		calculations it is important that	
8:13		calculations be consistent with the	
8:16		measured values in addition and	
8:19		subtraction operations answers should be	
8:21		rounded off to show the same digit as	
8:24		the digit expressing the least	
8:25		significant figure in the column above	
8:27		as shown in this graphic as shown in	
8:32		this next graph ache and multiplication	
8:34		or division operations the least number	
8:36		of significant figures in the answer	
8:38		should not exceed the least significant	
8:40		figures in any of the factors rounding	
8:44		off numbers is the process whereby one	
8:47		or more digits is dropped from a number	
8:49		so that it contains only the required	
8:51		number of significant figures when	
8:53		rounding off numbers to a required	
8:55		degree of accuracy one of the following	
8:58		methods shown on screen may be used	
9:01		first when the digit to be dropped is	
9:03		less than five the number remaining is	
9:06		simply stated without the digit second	
9:09		when the digit to be dropped is exactly	
9:11		five the nearest even number is used for	
9:14		the preceding digit this method	
9:16		establishes a consistent pattern and	
9:18		yields a better balance of results last	
9:23		when the digit to be dropped is more	
9:25		than five the nearest preceding digit is	
9:27		increased by one simpler stated	
9:30		percentage is an indication of a number	
9:33		of hundreds to a	
9:34		Heol if a square contains 100 smaller	
9:37		square parts then each of the smaller	
9:39		squares are 1/100 of the whole or 1% a	
9:43		simple percentage problem has three	
9:46		parts rate base and percentage in the	
9:50		graphic rate is the percent figure the	
9:53		base is the total quantity and the	
9:55		percentage is the quantity of the	
9:57		percent of the whole	
9:58		thus when computed 10% of 120 is 12	
10:03		note that the decimal point in the	
10:06		percent is moved two decimal places to	
10:08		the left to yield the correct number for	
10:11		the percentage there are three types of	
10:14		percentage problems we have already seen	
10:17		how to determine the percentage when	
10:18		given the base and rate now let's look	
10:21		at the next one finding the percent	
10:23		given the base in percentage in this	
10:27		graphic let's determine what rate or	
10:29		percent of 840 is 21 just divide 21 by	
10:34		40 which equals point zero two five or	
10:38		when the decimal point is moved two	
10:40		places right 2.5 percent in this example	
10:46		the last of our percentage problems	
10:48		given the rate in percentage we will	
10:50		find the base or hole as done in the	
10:53		graphic change the rate by moving its	
10:55		decimal point two places left and the	
10:58		divide and divide the percentage by it	
11:01		15 is 75 percent of what number the	
11:05		answer being twelve hundred and twenty a	
11:09		number squared is simply a number	
11:12		multiplied by itself such as 8 times 8	
11:15		equals 64 64 being the expression of 8	
11:19		squared or the base number raised to the	
11:22		second power a number that is cubed has	
11:27		been multiplied twice by itself such as	
11:30		2 cubed is 12 times 12 times 12 equals	
11:36		728 1728 is the expression of 12 to the	
11:42		third or 12 to the third power	
11:45		power is also called an exponent and	
11:48		signifies how many times a base number	
11:50		is to be multiplied by itself if an	
11:53		exponent is 5 this signifies a number	
11:55		raised to the fifth power as shown in	
11:58		the graphic 21 to the 5th equals 4	
12:02		million 84,000 101 all handheld	
12:07		calculators perform exponential	
12:09		operations with simple keystrokes so we	
12:11		will spend no further time on the topic	
12:14		surveyors generally measure linear in	
12:17		vertical dimensions in decimal survey	
12:19		feed angular dimensions of in degrees	
12:23		and units of area in acres and square	
12:26		feet however it is often necessary to	
12:29		convert these measurements to other	
12:31		measurement units such as decimal feet	
12:33		to feed in inches I will next discuss	
12:36		conversion operations that will make	
12:39		conversions simple and accurate	
12:41		first let's consider the u.s. survey	
12:44		foot and its relationship to the	
12:46		international metre and foot the	
12:50		official unit of length in the United	
12:51		States is the modern international meet	
12:54		meter defined at a world conference in	
12:57		959 this created a new definition for	
13:01		the foot in the United States called the	
13:03		standard foot all surveying prior to	
13:07		959 had been done on the old foot so it	
13:11		was decided to retain it and rename it	
13:13		the u.s. survey foot the graphic now on	
13:17		screen shows the correct relationship of	
13:20		US survey foot and the new international	
13:22		meter any conversion operation regarding	
13:26		meters and survey feet should carefully	
13:28		consider the correct constants surveyors	
13:31		normally work in feed and decimals	
13:34		however it is sometimes necessary to	
13:37		convert dimensions to feet and inches	
13:39		and vice versa as shown in this graphic	
13:44		convert 123 feet 7 and 3/4 inches to	
13:48		decimal feet in the first step reduce 7	
13:52		and 3/4 inches to decimal inches by	
13:54		reducing 3/4 of an inch to its decimal	
13:57		armed 0.75 inches in the second step	
14:03		.75 inches is reduced to a decimal a	
14:07		foot by dividing it by 12	
14:09		adding the decimal foot to 123 equals	
14:15		23 point 65 feet the reverse of foot an	
14:21		inch to decimal or decimal two feet in	
14:24		inches is shown in this graphic convert	
14:28		6 point 37 feet to feet and inches	
14:32		first take 0.37 feet and multiply it by	
14:36		2 converting it to four point 44 inches	
14:40		this decimal fraction reduces to 4 in 44	
14:44		one hundreds of an inch or most nearly	
14:46		/8 of an inch	
14:48		adding the forty six feet back into the	
14:51		conversion completes the operation at 46	
14:54		feet four and three eighths of an inch	
14:56		the number of decimal places rounded to	
14:59		will be dictated by the accuracy	
15:01		required for the work during colonial	
15:05		times the most popular measuring device	
15:07		in the United States was the Gunter's	
15:09		chain it was 66 feet long and was	
15:13		divided into 100 links each 7.92 inches	
15:17		in length as can be seen in this graphic	
15:20		it was very well-suited for surveying	
15:22		work in English units converting feet	
15:25		chains is accomplished dividing by	
15:28		dividing the number of feet by 66 on the	
15:32		graphic this operation yields 26 point	
15:35		oh nine chains or 26 chains	
15:38		 links in this example we are	
15:42		converting chains to feet simply done	
15:45		multiply the distance expressed in	
15:47		chains and lengths by 66 feet the	
15:50		previous graphic showed the relationship	
15:53		of area to chain units or 10 square	
15:56		chains equals 1 acre or 43,560 square	
16:00		feet the bottom conversion problem on	
16:04		the present screen converts a	
16:06		rectangular parcel measured in chains to	
16:09		area	
16:11		the sexagesimal system or base 67 system	
16:16		of angular measurement is used by	
16:18		surveyors in the United States and in	
16:20		many other parts of the world this	
16:23		system is based on a complete circle	
16:26		being divided into 360 parts or degrees	
16:29		each degree is subdivided into 60 parts	
16:33		or minutes with each minute divided into	
16:35		0 seconds as shown in the graphic the	
16:38		European system divides the circle into	
16:41		00 parts called grads each grad is	
16:45		subdivided into 100 parts or centigrades	
16:48		Center grads are further divided into	
16:50		00 parts called milligrams	
16:53		when using degrees minutes and seconds	
16:56		and calculations it is often necessary	
16:58		to convert them to decimal form and vice	
17:01		versa	
17:01		in order to make the numbers compatible	
17:04		with calculators being used for instance	
17:07		is shown here 3420 135	
17:12		- 34 point three five nine seven two	
17:16		degrees in decimal format or 96 point	
17:22		three nine one six seven degrees	
17:24		converts to 96 degrees 23 minutes 30	
17:28		seconds conversions of degrees to	
17:31		decimal form is also shown in this	
17:33		graphic conversion from decimal format	
17:37		sixty three point three one seven eight	
17:40		four degrees two degrees 63 1904 seconds	
17:47		is shown in this graphic remember it is	
17:50		always required to convert to decimal	
17:52		form before using most calculators	
17:55		unless they are pre-programmed to make	
17:58		the degrees two decimals and vice versa	
18:00		vice versa conversion Radian measure is	
18:05		another definition of angular measure	
18:07		and has proven quite convenient for	
18:09		extensive calculations such as those	
18:12		involving circular curves and	
18:14		statistical analysis of sets of angles	
18:17		the basic relationship of radians to	
18:20		degrees is shown on this graphic	
18:23		remember to convert	
18:25		degrees to decimal form when converting	
18:27		to radians the most commonly accepted	
18:31		unit of area in land surveying is the	
18:34		acre which contains 43,560 square feet	
18:39		other units of area and their	
18:41		relationship to acres in square feet is	
18:44		shown on this graph a conversions to	
18:47		corresponding units may be made by	
18:49		inspection of this table in your	
18:51		workbook this portion of the unit will	
18:55		Center on random error I must caution	
18:58		the viewer the time prevents a complete	
19:01		discussion of all types a survey	
19:03		measurement error other than random I	
19:06		recommend additional study outside the	
19:09		training video to completely understand	
19:11		error in survey measurement a random	
19:15		measurement error is defined as the	
19:17		difference between a measured quantity	
19:19		and its true dimension human limitations	
19:22		limitations on the manufacturing	
19:25		position of survey instruments and other	
19:28		uncertainties act in concert to prevent	
19:31		ever making a true measurement therefore	
19:35		it can be stated that no measurement is	
19:37		exact and will always contain some error	
19:39		of unknown size it is impossible to	
19:43		prevent error and it should be an	
19:45		objective of the surveyor to recognize	
19:48		error and control it random errors are	
19:51		unavoidable they follow laws of	
19:54		probability and tend to be of either	
19:56		sign and are quite small hence they tend	
19:59		almost but not quite cancel each other	
20:02		out	
20:03		making a set of measurements of the same	
20:06		quantity and then studying the results	
20:08		will indicate differences in value and	
20:11		express the reliability of each	
20:13		measurement by showing its different	
20:15		difference from the mean of the set an	
20:18		analysis will determine and quantify the	
20:21		mean or most probable value of the set	
20:24		to truth however before we explore this	
20:28		process let's define some of the terms	
20:30		involved in the first term shown on the	
20:34		graphic is most probable value the most	
20:37		probable value	
20:38		is also the arithmetic mean or average	
20:41		of the set the next term considered is	
20:45		shown in this graphic it is called the	
20:47		residual and is the difference between a	
20:50		single measurement and the most probable	
20:52		value residuals play a key role in the	
20:56		analysis process that we will be looking	
20:58		at in a minute	
20:59		this graphic shows the next term to be	
21:02		defined the standard error this factor	
21:05		defines the value or accuracy of a set	
21:08		of measurements and sets the limit	
21:10		within which 68% of the measurements	
21:13		will fall the probable error modifies	
21:17		the standard error and is shown on this	
21:19		screen it fixes the limits between which	
21:22		0% of the measurements within a set	
21:24		would fall other modifications are shown	
21:27		and are known as the 90% error and the	
21:30		5 percent error which set limits within	
21:33		which 90% in 95 percent of the	
21:36		measurements respectively will fall the	
21:40		most probable value of a set of	
21:42		measurements is the mean or average as	
21:45		you will see the mean is derived from	
21:47		the set so it too is subject to random	
21:51		error the mean is awful often accepted	
21:54		as a final result so it's dependability	
21:57		should be quantified the equation for	
22:01		standard error of the mean is shown on	
22:03		this graphic the standard error of the	
22:05		mean can be modified to reflect the 90%	
22:08		error and the 95 percent errors also by	
22:11		applying the same modifiers shown in the	
22:13		last graphic to put all of our foregoing	
22:17		discussion and equations and error	
22:19		computation into use let's take a look	
22:22		at the current graphic totaling totaling	
22:26		the lengths equals the summation of six	
22:28		thousand seven hundred and seventy seven	
22:30		point forty two feet this divided by six	
22:33		and number of measurements yields the	
22:36		most probable value of one thousand one	
22:38		hundred and twenty nine point fifty	
22:40		seven feet determining the residuals	
22:43		squaring them and then totaling them	
22:46		equals a residual summation of zero	
22:49		point zero one six	
22:51		eight when this figure is plugged into	
22:53		the equation for standard error of the	
22:56		set the result is plus or minus 0.05	
23:00		feet rounded to two places	
23:02		this means that 68% of the measurements	
23:06		within the set will fall between 1129	
23:10		point 52 feet and 1129 point 62 feet the	
23:16		standard error of the mean was found to	
23:19		be plus or minus 0.02 feet which	
23:23		signifies there is a 68 percent	
23:26		probability that the true distance lies	
23:29		somewhere in the range between 1129	
23:32		point 55 feet and 1129 point 59 feet	
23:40		until this point we have been discussing	
23:42		errors affecting only a single	
23:45		measurement random error also affects	
23:48		measurements resulting from combining	
23:50		two or more quantities by computational	
23:52		processes a sum or product of separate	
23:56		measurements each with its distinct	
23:58		random error will have a total random	
24:00		error influenced by a composite of the	
24:03		individual errors	
24:04		the first propagation of error process	
24:07		we will look at is identifying the error	
24:11		created in a sum of a number of several	
24:13		measurements made under different	
24:16		independent conditions a line has been	
24:19		measured in four segments each segment	
24:22		under different conditions yielding a	
24:24		different standard error for each	
24:25		segment in this graphic the estimated	
24:28		standard error for the sum of the	
24:30		measurements is determined to be plus or	
24:33		minus 0.05 for feet next to be	
24:39		considered is the error developed in	
24:41		multiplication of measurements such as	
24:43		for determining areas this graphic	
24:47		illustrates the determination of	
24:48		expected error in a calculated product	
24:51		the completed calculation states the	
24:54		product has a standard error of plus or	
24:57		minus 3.0 - square feet	
25:02		this error occurs when a series of	
25:04		measurements made under the same	
25:06		conditions are totaled up each of the	
25:09		measurements are subject to the same	
25:11		random error intend to cancel each other	
25:13		out the equation for this computation is	
25:17		shown in this graphic this process	
25:20		states the distance 2,175 feet was	
25:24		measured with an accuracy of plus or	
25:27		minus 0.12 feet I would remind the	
25:32		viewer again that random error is	
25:35		inevitable in survey measurement live	
25:37		with it and learn to identify and	
25:39		control it do not waste time trying to	
25:42		eliminate it algebra can be considered	
25:46		an extension of arithmetic in which	
25:48		symbols represent unknown quantities	
25:50		related to known factors of an	
25:52		expression all knowns and unknowns are	
25:56		integral to operations that are	
25:58		consistent two numbers in the expression	
26:00		I include the following discussion to	
26:03		develop a basic awareness in solving	
26:06		four unknowns and to develop thus	
26:07		whicker's skill in working with negative	
26:10		numbers numbers in mathematics are three	
26:15		categories positive numbers that are	
26:18		greater than 0 negative numbers that are	
26:21		less than 0 and 0 itself which needs no	
26:25		explanation as shown in the sketch	
26:28		signed numbers to the left to 0 are	
26:31		considered negative and are always	
26:32		preceded by a minus sign numbers to the	
26:36		right of 0 are positive numbers and may	
26:39		or may not be preceded by a positive	
26:41		sign the absolute value of a number is	
26:44		its value without reference to a sign	
26:47		thereby positive 6 would have the same	
26:50		absolute value as negative 6 in working	
26:54		with sign numbers there are certain	
26:56		guidelines to follow in avoiding	
26:58		blunders and getting answers with	
27:00		incorrect signs first let's consider the	
27:03		addition of signed numbers as shown in	
27:06		this screen the sum of two positive	
27:09		numbers is positive 46 plus 34 equals 80	
27:15		the sum of two negative numbers is	
27:18		negative minus 21 plus minus 76 equals	
27:24		minus 97 the sum of a positive and	
27:28		negative number will be first determine	
27:32		the difference in absolute value of	
27:33		number of the number positive if the	
27:37		absolute value of the positive number is	
27:39		larger 82 plus negative 31 equals 51	
27:44		negative if the absolute value of the	
27:47		negative number is larger 26 plus	
27:50		negative 67 equals negative 41 the next	
27:55		case of sine number operations the	
27:58		subtraction operation the rule is rather	
28:01		uncomplicated when subtracting one	
28:04		signed number from another simply	
28:06		reverse the sign of the second number	
28:08		and then add the two numbers using the	
28:10		addition rules just discussed	
28:13		multiplication of signed numbers is also	
28:16		a very simple rule to follow the product	
28:19		of two positive numbers is always	
28:21		positive while the product of a negative	
28:24		negative number and a positive number	
28:26		will always be negative	
28:28		however the product of two negative	
28:31		numbers will always be a positive number	
28:34		the last case of operations with sign	
28:37		numbers concerns division the rule for	
28:40		division is the same as multiplication	
28:42		the quotient of two positive numbers is	
28:45		positive while the quotient of two	
28:48		negative numbers is also positive the	
28:50		quotient of a negative number and a	
28:52		positive number is always negative an	
28:56		algebraic equation should be thought of	
28:58		as a math statement that is balanced on	
29:01		both sides of its equal signs or	
29:03		quantities on the left side must equal	
29:06		the quantities on the right side each	
29:08		side of an equation may be modified but	
29:11		remember to modify each side by exactly	
29:14		the same degree and quantity or do the	
29:16		same thing to both sides an equation is	
29:20		used to find the value of an unknown	
29:22		number from its relationship to the	
29:25		known values in the equation the ability	
29:28		to visualize	
29:29		mathematical problem in words and then	
29:31		form it into an equation is a valuable	
29:33		skill for the surveyor for example in	
29:38		this graphic unknowns are identified as	
29:41		B or Z and then equations are formed	
29:43		from the word statements to reach	
29:45		solutions as shown by the two examples	
29:50		in this graphic equations are formed	
29:52		from conditions set by a word statement	
29:54		a number divided by three plus the same	
29:59		number times seven equates to be divided	
30:03		by three plus B times seven a number	
30:08		plus two hundred and twelve times eight	
30:11		plus the same number divided by 34	
30:14		equates to Z plus 212 times eight plus Z	
30:22		divided by 34 when working with more	
30:26		than two quantities in an algebraic	
30:28		expression perform the indicated work in	
30:32		the order presented in the next graphic	
30:35		work from the left doing multiplication	
30:37		and division work from the left again	
30:41		doing addition and subtraction	
30:43		operations for example twenty two	
30:48		hundred and sixty seven times six plus	
30:51		6 divided by four minus four times 12	
30:55		minus nine reduces to 1602 plus twenty	
31:02		six minus 48 minus nine equals fifteen	
31:06		hundred and seventy-one the second	
31:09		example 301 minus twenty-two times	
31:13		fourteen plus 81 divided by 27 minus 76	
31:19		reduces to 301 minus three hundred and	
31:23		eight plus three minus 76 equals	
31:27		negative eighty in algebra it is often	
31:32		necessary to group terms and consider a	
31:34		whole group of several groups as a	
31:36		single term grouping is indicated by	
31:40		parentheses brackets	
31:42		braces the plus or minus sign in front	
31:46		of each group applies to each term in	
31:49		the group rules for removing parentheses	
31:52		are presented in this graphic	
31:54		if parentheses are preceded by a	
31:58		positive sign they can be removed	
32:01		without changing the signs of terms	
32:03		inside if preceded by a negative sign	
32:07		remove the parentheses by changing the	
32:10		sign of every term within the group it	
32:13		is much like multiplying a group by +1	
32:16		or by negative 1 first 5x plus 3y minus	
32:23		z equals 5x plus 3y minus 4z second 5x	
32:32		minus 3y minus 4z	
32:35		is reduced to 5x minus 3y plus 4z	
32:40		oftentimes there are several groups in	
32:43		one problem in this case remove the	
32:46		intercept first and then the outer set	
32:48		and so on following the prior stated	
32:50		rules an algebraic equation contains	
32:54		signs for sum of all the four	
32:57		mathematical operations add subtract	
33:00		multiply or divide and also letters that	
33:04		are substitutes for numbers these	
33:06		letters are called variables and when	
33:09		replaced by actual number values through	
33:11		substitution the equation is simplified	
33:14		when simplifying an equation simply plug	
33:18		assigned numbers into the variables and	
33:20		then combine the terms following the	
33:23		rules of order of operations as shown in	
33:26		this graphic make the following	
33:28		substitutions let a equal 12 B equals 6	
33:33		and x equals 7 X plus a times B minus B	
33:41		equals 7 plus 12 times 6 minus 6 or 7	
33:48		plus 72 minus 6 equals 73 solving	
33:54		equations	
33:55		equations are generally solved by	
33:57		picking out one of the unknowns	
33:59		isolating it and then solving for it	
34:01		something to keep in mind it is much	
34:04		easier to manipulate the variables and	
34:06		reach a formulated solution prior to	
34:10		substituting actual numerical values for	
34:14		example let's solve this equation for R	
34:16		assuming we already know the value of a	
34:19		let's follow the solution on the graphic	
34:22		keeping in mind to do the same thing to	
34:25		both sides of the equation area of a	
34:28		circle is a equals pi times radius	
34:31		squared solve for radius let a equal	
34:36		,500 3 square feet rearrange R squared	
34:42		equals area divided by pi extract the	
34:47		square root R equals the square root of	
34:50		area divided by pi up to this point	
34:55		equations and the processes discussed	
34:58		have been elementary first power	
35:00		equations in many problems squares cubes	
35:03		and higher powers will occur a quadratic	
35:07		equation is a function which contains	
35:09		the second power of one unknown a	
35:12		quadratic equation useful for surveying	
35:15		computations is generally written as ax	
35:19		squared plus BX plus C equals 0 a B and	
35:25		C are generally numbers with X remaining	
35:29		as a value SOT for ease of solution the	
35:32		quadratic equation is reduced to the	
35:35		quadratic formula shown in this graphic	
35:38		there is a plus or minus sign in front	
35:41		of the square root sign this will yield	
35:43		two different answers when solving a	
35:45		quadratic you must determine by a	
35:48		careful analysis of the problem which is	
35:51		the correct answer	
35:53		familiar familiarity with algebra gives	
35:56		the surveyor	
35:57		the ability and tools to reduce a	
35:59		problem to a logical solution by	
36:02		arriving at and correctly setting up an	
36:04		albert algebraic formula it is much	
36:07		easier to work with	
36:09		equations before they have the numbers	
36:11		plugged in when the solution has been	
36:14		found in the equation set up then and	
36:16		only then should the numbers come into	
36:18		play I highly recommend keeping your	
36:21		calculations as simple as possible don't	
36:24		add any unnecessary steps an extra set	
36:28		an extra step just increases your	
36:31		chances of making any blunder or	
36:32		calculation error geometry is as old as	
36:37		civilization we know the Sumerians and	
36:40		the Egyptians had the knowledge of and	
36:42		applied the principles of geometry in	
36:44		fact a translation of the Greek word	
36:47		geometry means earth measurement	
36:50		geometrical facts figures and formulas	
36:52		are essential to understanding and	
36:55		applying mathematical processes to	
36:58		survey the following definitions will	
37:01		provide a brief review of geometric	
37:03		principles we will start our discussion	
37:05		with some of the basic corollaries or	
37:08		laws of geometry let's first talk about	
37:12		lines as shown in example number one of	
37:15		this graph eight straight lines extend	
37:17		to infinity in both directions example	
37:20		number two shows that a straight lines	
37:23		in the same plane meet they are	
37:25		intersecting lines and share a common	
37:27		point example number three proves that	
37:31		if two straight lines have no common	
37:33		point they are parallel lines a line	
37:37		extending to infinity from a defined	
37:39		starting point as a half line as shown	
37:42		in Figure number four as shown in Figure	
37:46		number five a line starting from a	
37:48		defined starting point and ending at	
37:51		another defined point as a line segment	
37:55		angles are formed when two half lines or	
37:59		segments are drawn from the same	
38:00		starting point you can also form an	
38:03		angle by rotating a half line about its	
38:06		starting point which is also the vertex	
38:09		of the angle formed the dimension of the	
38:12		angle formed is measured and stated in	
38:14		degrees or radians this graphic shows	
38:18		the different types of angles in their	
38:20		definition	
38:21		as shown angles are classified as acute	
38:25		less than 90 degrees right exactly 90	
38:29		degrees	
38:29		obtuse between 90 and 180 degrees	
38:33		straight exactly 180 degrees reflux	
38:38		between 180 and 360 degrees a pair of	
38:44		angles the total 90 degrees are called	
38:47		complementary angles	
38:48		this means that 37 degrees would be the	
38:51		complement to 53 degrees two angles that	
38:56		total up to 180 degrees are defined as	
38:59		supplementary angles	
39:00		in other words 68 degrees would be the	
39:04		supplement to 112 degrees in geometry	
39:08		certain basic theorems or statements	
39:11		exist to serve as basic rules I am	
39:14		presenting some of the rules in the next	
39:16		few graphics to give you some more basic	
39:19		geometrical concepts about lines and	
39:21		angles proof of the theorems presented	
39:25		has been omitted from my presentation	
39:27		the rules are sufficient to stand on	
39:29		their own rule number one when two lines	
39:33		intersect angles formed opposite to each	
39:36		other are identical	
39:37		thus angle 1 equals angle 3 and angle 2	
39:41		equals angle 4 rule number 2 when two	
39:46		parallel lines are intersected by a	
39:48		transverse line the into alternate	
39:51		interior angles formed are the same as	
39:54		shown angle 1 equals angle 3 and angle 2	
39:58		equals angle 4 rule number 3 when two	
40:03		parallel lines are intersected by a	
40:05		transverse line the corresponding angles	
40:08		formed are the same as shown angle 1	
40:11		equals angle 5 angle 2 equals angle 6	
40:15		angle 3 equals angle 7 and angle 4	
40:19		equals angle 8 rule number 4 two angles	
40:24		are the same or supplement each other if	
40:26		their corresponding sides are	
40:27		perpendicular as shown angle 1 equals	
40:30		angle 2 and angle 2 plus angle 4	
40:34		equals 180 degrees almost all surveying	
40:38		operations and computations involve	
40:41		geometrical figures therefore I will be	
40:44		presenting most of the basic ones	
40:46		encountered in our work along with a	
40:48		brief look at some of the properties and	
40:50		rules of the figures let's start with	
40:53		our old friend the circle this often	
40:55		used figure is the basis of horizontal	
40:58		curve computation and layout as	
41:00		explained in another of the video units	
41:02		a circle can be defined as a closed	
41:05		curve in the same plane every point of	
41:08		which is the same distance or radius	
41:10		from a point within the circle called	
41:13		the center of the circle or radius point	
41:15		in this graphic the basic portions a	
41:19		circle are identified if you traveled	
41:22		entirely around circle starting at Point	
41:25		a and return to point a you would have	
41:28		walked the circumference of the circle	
41:29		if you went from point A along the	
41:32		straight line to point C which is the	
41:35		diameter which is set bisects the circle	
41:38		the line from the radius point to point	
41:41		B represents the radius which is 1/2 the	
41:44		diameter	
41:45		back to walking around the circle again	
41:47		the distance from point B to Point C	
41:50		describes an arc also if a line is drawn	
41:55		from the center of a circle line from Rp	
41:58		to point F perpendicular to a chord it	
42:01		bisects the chord and the arc defined by	
42:04		the chord this important rule comes into	
42:07		play when working with circular Highway	
42:08		curves sector and segment are another	
42:13		two elements of a curve that should be	
42:15		familiar to a surveyor as they are often	
42:18		used to calculate areas of surveys with	
42:21		curved boundaries as shown in this	
42:24		graphic the sector of an arc is the	
42:26		shaded wedge-shaped figure bounded by	
42:29		its arc and two radial lines its area is	
42:33		determined by the formula shown in the	
42:35		graph a sector area equals radius	
42:39		squared times Delta expressed in radians	
42:42		divided by two note on the graphic that	
42:46		the radius of the	
42:47		ARC is 139 feet in the Delta angle is 47	
42:52		degrees 30 minutes let's stop the tape	
42:55		at this point and work the problem okay	
42:59		you have turned the tape back on let's	
43:01		check your answer I get eight thousand	
43:04		nine square feet what did you get this	
43:08		screen shown this shows the second	
43:10		curved element under discussion the	
43:12		segment of arc	
43:13		it is the shaded area and is defined as	
43:16		bounded by its arc and the cord forts	
43:19		are the area of a segment is calculated	
43:23		by the method now on screen first	
43:25		determine the area of the sector of an	
43:27		arc o PR by the formula just discussed	
43:33		sector area equals radius squared times	
43:37		Delta expressed in radians divided by	
43:39		two then determine area of triangle OPR	
43:44		the formula for this triangle is radius	
43:48		squared divided by 2 times sine Delta	
43:51		when both areas are computed subtract	
43:55		the area of the inscribed triangle from	
43:57		the sector area there by finding the	
43:59		area of the segment letting R equal 421	
44:04		point 25 feet and Delta equaling 228° 31	
44:11		minutes and 15 seconds shut the tape off	
44:14		and compute the area of segment OAC then	
44:18		turn the tape back on to check your	
44:20		answer with mine okay I got 44,000 166	
44:27		square feet for the sector area in	
44:30		2,000 365 square feet for the inscribed	
44:34		triangle subtracting the triangle from	
44:37		the sector gave me the area of the	
44:39		sector 100 1801 square feet is this what	
44:44		you got some other formulas dealing with	
44:48		curves are shown in this graphic they	
44:50		are circumference equals 2 times pi	
44:53		times radius area equals pi times radius	
44:58		squared radius equals	
45:02		.564 1/9 times square root of area	
45:07		diameter equals one point one two eight	
45:11		three eight times square root of area	
45:14		well this pretty well finishes the	
45:16		discussion of circles so let's move on	
45:19		and discuss some more geometrical	
45:21		figures that you will likely encounter	
45:23		in your surveying and test-taking	
45:25		activities a polygon defines any figure	
45:30		bounded by three or more line segments a	
45:33		polygon may have any number of sides as	
45:36		long as they are broken that is segments	
45:39		segmented and enclose a figure the	
45:42		simplest polygon is the triangle having	
45:44		the least number of sides 3 the triangle	
45:49		is one of the most used figures in	
45:51		surveying and survey calculation it has	
45:54		many configurations and classification	
45:56		let's take a look at them triangles are	
46:00		classified in two different ways by	
46:02		sides and by angles first we will look	
46:05		at the triangles classified by sides the	
46:09		first of three types of triangles	
46:11		classified by sides are shown in S	
46:15		figure 1 in this graphic this triangle	
46:18		is called an isosceles triangle and is	
46:21		distinguished by having two equal length	
46:23		sides	
46:24		note that the unequal side is called the	
46:27		base and that the angle opposite the	
46:29		base is the vertex angle the second type	
46:33		of triangle on this classification is	
46:35		shown in Figure 2 and is called an	
46:37		equilateral triangle this one has all	
46:40		three sides of equal length the third	
46:43		and last triangle in this classification	
46:45		is the scalene triangle and it has three	
46:49		unequal size is shown in Figure three in	
46:52		this graphic triangles are also	
46:55		classified by the angles they contain	
46:57		there are three types of triangles	
47:00		within this classification acute obtuse	
47:04		and right we will look at Figure one in	
47:07		this graphic and discuss the acute	
47:10		triangle first this type of triangle has	
47:13		three akyuu	
47:14		less than 90 degree angles type number	
47:18		to figure to has one angle of the three	
47:21		that is an obtuse triangle more than 90	
47:24		degrees less than 180 degrees the other	
47:28		two angles of the triangle are always Q	
47:31		the last type in the angular	
47:33		classification has one angle that is	
47:36		exactly 90 degrees the other two angles	
47:38		of the right triangle will always be a Q	
47:41		as shown in Figure three of this graphic	
47:44		the side opposite of the right angle	
47:46		would be called the hypotenuse the right	
47:49		triangle is the workhorse of survey	
47:51		measurement in calculation and will be	
47:54		discussed in greater detail later in	
47:56		this video unit the next few graphics	
47:59		show polygons other than triangles these	
48:03		are polygons having more than three	
48:05		sides familiar familiarity with any of	
48:09		these polygons will prove useful to the	
48:11		surveyor and test taker before we look	
48:14		at any of the polygons let me state a	
48:16		golden rule concerning interior angles	
48:18		of any polygon the sum of the interior	
48:22		angles of any polygon is equal to 180	
48:25		degrees times the total number of sides	
48:27		less to this formula provides a check of	
48:31		interior angles measured for a closed	
48:33		figure the first polygons to be	
48:36		considered are the ones defined as	
48:39		regular or having all sides and angles	
48:41		equal as shown in these next graphics	
48:44		polygons are named for the number of	
48:46		sides a formula for area computation is	
48:49		also shown in each of the graphics the	
48:53		first regular polygons to be considered	
48:55		is the equilateral triangle all three	
48:57		sides the same length its area is easily	
49:01		computed by the formula area equals 0.25	
49:06		times n number of sides times side	
49:11		squared times cotangent of 180 divided	
49:14		by n also shown as the symbology for the	
49:19		formula where we let n stand for the	
49:21		number of sides and s for the length of	
49:23		the sides which are identical in this	
49:25		case	
49:26		the next regular polygon to be discussed	
49:29		in the series should have been the	
49:31		four-sided square however its properties	
49:34		are well known so let's move on to the	
49:37		Pentagon or five sided figure this	
49:41		graphic shows a regular pentagon five	
49:43		equal sides and angles computation of	
49:46		its area is also by the same formula in	
49:49		fact this formula can be used to compute	
49:51		the area of any regular polygon	
49:53		regardless of the number of sides again	
49:57		n equals number of sides and s equals	
50:00		the length of the sides which are	
50:02		identical in length this graphic shows a	
50:06		regular hexagon six equal sides and	
50:09		angles computation of its area is by the	
50:12		same formula there is no need to look at	
50:15		any more regular polygons as the pattern	
50:17		of construction and area formula should	
50:19		be very clear by now	
50:22		surveyors should be interested in the in	
50:25		the additional polygons discussed in the	
50:27		next few graphics they consist of	
50:29		various forms of quadrilaterals or	
50:32		four-sided figures the square and	
50:34		rectangle will not be discussed as they	
50:36		should be very familiar to the viewer	
50:39		the parallelogram is a quadrilateral	
50:41		with the opposing sides equal in	
50:44		parallel all its angles are different	
50:47		than 90 degrees except in the case a	
50:49		rectangle which has 90-degree angles a	
50:53		parallelogram that is not a rectangle	
50:55		can also be considered a rhomboid as	
50:58		shown on the graphic the rhomboids area	
51:01		b can be calculated by area equals a	
51:04		times B times sine theta a and B	
51:09		symbolize the length of their respective	
51:11		sides this graphic shows a parallelogram	
51:16		or rhomboid with all sides of equal	
51:19		length this figure is a sketch of a	
51:21		rhombus its area is computed from the	
51:24		formula area equals b squared times sine	
51:29		theta	
51:30		letting B equal the link to the sides a	
51:34		quadrilateral with only two of its sides	
51:37		parallel is	
51:38		named a trapezoid and is shown in this	
51:40		graphic this configuration is one	
51:43		heavily used for engineering design in	
51:45		layout it's areas determined from the	
51:48		following formula area equals H divided	
51:52		by 2 times B plus B Prime in this	
51:57		formula B stands for the lengths of	
51:59		sides and H is the altitude a trap Azia	
52:03		is defined as a quadrilateral with none	
52:06		of its sides being parallel it's area is	
52:09		calculated by the equation area equals D	
52:13		times H over 2 plus B over 4 times H	
52:18		prime plus H double prime where B equals	
52:23		the bottom width D equals the top width	
52:25		H the first altitude and H double Prime	
52:29		the second altitude the irregular	
52:32		Pentagon is the last of the plane	
52:34		geometric figures I will discuss this	
52:38		figure has five sides none of which are	
52:41		parallel or equal in length also none of	
52:45		its angles are equal its area can be	
52:48		calculated by the equation on the	
52:50		graphic which is the same one discussed	
52:52		in the last graphic I have reviewed many	
52:56		of the basic and fundamental facts found	
52:59		in geometry time prevents a complete	
53:02		review of a subject that takes many	
53:04		hours of study and practice to fully	
53:06		appreciate however the aspiring surveyor	
53:09		and/or examinee should further pursue	
53:12		the study of geometry as I have only	
53:14		touched the surface of the subject there	
53:17		are certain geometrical constructions	
53:19		that have a great value in solutions of	
53:21		surveying problems in calculations well	
53:25		as much as I enjoy talking about	
53:26		surveying math and numbers I feel that	
53:29		perhaps this is a good time to take a	
53:31		break when we come back we will launch	
53:33		into a study of trigonometry welcome	
53:40		back from Bay if you're ready we'll	
53:42		continue our discussion of survey	
53:44		mathematics with a look of trigonometry	
53:47		trigonometry is the natural extension of	
53:49		algebra and geometry and gives the	
53:51		surveyor the tools to conveniently solve	
53:54		problems involving	
53:56		unknown angles and distances true we're	
53:59		neighbors the surveyor to take advantage	
54:01		of the relationship of angular dimension	
54:03		to distance measurement and put the	
54:05		principles of solving or indirect or	
54:07		missing measurements in to use the right	
54:11		triangle is the first and most important	
54:13		element of trigonometry that we will	
54:16		cover it is a simplest of triangles and	
54:19		plays a major role in just about all the	
54:21		measurements and computations we do a	
54:24		right triangle has been defined earlier	
54:27		as any triangle that includes an angle	
54:30		of exactly 90 degrees as one of its	
54:32		three angles it showed in this graphic	
54:35		the longest side and any right triangle	
54:37		is called the hypotenuse in lying	
54:40		opposite angle C is also called side C	
54:42		the side opposite angle a side a is	
54:46		called the opposite side in the	
54:48		remaining side which is opposite angle B	
54:51		is side B or the adjacent side the	
54:54		triangle is shown is is the standard	
54:57		figure both in position in terminology	
54:59		for solution of all trigonometric	
55:02		functions and equations the Pythagorean	
55:06		theorem applied only to right triangles	
55:09		states that the square of the hypotenuse	
55:12		of any right triangle is equal to the	
55:14		sum of the squares of the opposite side	
55:16		and adjacent side as shown in the screen	
55:20		the equation form for this theorem is	
55:23		side a squared plus side B squared	
55:27		equals C squared this basic equation may	
55:31		be rearranged to provide solutions	
55:33		regardless of which side of the right	
55:35		triangle the side the arrangement has	
55:38		provided the other three equations	
55:40		can be used to find whichever side was	
55:42		sad as shown silane is found by solving	
55:46		for the square root of side C squared	
55:49		minus side B squared side B is found by	
55:54		solving for the square root of side C	
55:56		squared minus side a squared	
55:59		side C is found by solving for the	
56:02		square root of side a squared plus side	
56:05		B squared let's try a practice solution	
56:09		for the problem shown in the upcoming	
56:11		graphic given the right triangle shown	
56:15		on screen solve for side C at this point	
56:19		pause the tape and solve the problem	
56:22		okay now that you're finished this is	
56:25		how I found the answer first rearranging	
56:28		the basic equation we get C squared	
56:31		equals a squared plus B squared which	
56:34		reduces to finding the square root of	
56:36		the quantity 1444 plus 7390 6 it equals	
56:45		840 the square root of 8840 B maybe 4.0	
56:51		 feet or the length of side C fairly	
56:54		routine isn't it any right triangle the	
56:59		difference in the lengths of two sides	
57:00		determines the size of the included	
57:02		angle therefore the ratio between the	
57:06		lengths would determine the magnitude of	
57:08		certain trigonometric functions or	
57:09		ratios the names and elements of the	
57:13		first three ratios of different sides	
57:15		and the right triangle to each other are	
57:17		shown in this next screen note that the	
57:21		ratios are defined in terms assigned to	
57:23		sides and angles of the standard right	
57:25		triangle we have already discussed in	
57:27		was shown a few graphics ago remember	
57:30		that the size of the triangles does not	
57:32		affect the magnitude of the functions	
57:34		they are determined solely from the	
57:36		differences in two lines being compared	
57:39		this graphic shows sine equals sine a	
57:43		equals side a over side C equals	
57:47		opposite side over	
57:49		newse cosine equals cosine a equals side	
57:54		B over side C equals adjacent side over	
57:58		hypotenuse tangent equals tangent a	
58:01		equals side a over side B equals	
58:06		opposite side over adjacent side the	
58:10		other three trig functions are shown in	
58:12		this graphic in our cotangent equals	
58:15		cotangent a equals adjacent side over	
58:19		opposite side secant equals suki na	
58:23		equals hypotenuse over adjacent side and	
58:27		cosecant equals cosecant a equals	
58:32		hypotenuse over opposite side formulas	
58:36		for ratio of functions are made to be	
58:38		rearranged to satisfy specific needs or	
58:41		required so ssin since functions are	
58:44		derived from sides of triangles the	
58:47		functions can be used to determine	
58:49		lengths of missing sides all that is	
58:51		needed is one given side and a given	
58:54		angle to solve for missing side missing	
58:58		sides of right triangles can be solved	
59:00		by the application of one of the	
59:02		rearranged equations shown in the next	
59:05		two graphics selection of which function	
59:08		to apply depends on which side or angle	
59:10		you want to solve for and what elements	
59:13		of the triangle are already known as	
59:17		shown on this screen all the function	
59:19		ratios have been rearranged to provide a	
59:22		specific formula to solve for a	
59:24		particular problem these are the first	
59:26		three to be discussed side a equals side	
59:31		C times sine of a or equals side B times	
59:37		tangent of a side B equals side C times	
59:42		cosine a or side a times cotangent a	
59:47		side C equals side a divided by sine a	
59:53		or side B divided by cosine a this	
59:59		graphic shows level three sets of really	
60:01		trig functions for solving like	
60:03		triangles side a equals side C times	
60:08		cosine B or side B times cotangent b	
60:13		side b equals side C times sine B equals	
60:18		side a times tangent B side C equals	
60:23		side a over sine B equals side B over	
60:30		cosine B inspection of a problem and	
60:33		then a correct choice of function always	
60:36		yields the correct solution providing	
60:38		the simple math like multiplication and	
60:40		division is done correctly there are two	
60:44		distinct operations when working with	
60:46		trig functions one is to determine the	
60:48		numerical function for a given angle the	
60:52		other is to determine interval from a	
60:55		given numerical function electronic	
60:57		calculators provide a quick and accurate	
61:00		method for finding functions in art	
61:02		functions all calculators have keys	
61:05		marked sine cosine and tangent simply	
61:09		enter the angle generally in decimal of	
61:12		degrees for map for most handheld	
61:14		calculators and press the key designated	
61:17		for the function inside such a	
61:19		calculator to read out to the nearest	
61:21		six decimal places in order to provide	
61:24		the act the correct accuracy to be	
61:27		consistent with today's surveying	
61:28		instruments for example in this graphic	
61:32		what is the value of the cosine function	
61:34		for 33 degrees six minutes 23 seconds it	
61:39		is zero point seven three zero zero	
61:42		eight six the second operation is what	
61:46		what is the arc function value of a	
61:48		given numerical trig function what is	
61:51		the arc sine value of zero point zero	
61:54		four	
61:55		eight nine three it is two degrees 24	
62:00		minutes in six seconds let's talk about	
62:04		finding missing elements of a triangle	
62:07		by using trig for our presentation the	
62:10		missing elements will fall into two	
62:12		categories	
62:13		solving for missing angle with two sides	
62:15		known and solving for missing side with	
62:18		one side and angle now remember that	
62:22		sine cosine and tangent values are	
62:24		unique to a particular bearing or angle	
62:27		all the triangle equations can be	
62:31		manipulated to find any of the missing	
62:33		values as long as any two of the	
62:36		triangles other values are known let's	
62:39		solve for missing angle when using given	
62:43		data from a triangle we want to solve	
62:46		for angle a given side be inside a as	
62:51		shown on this graphic side a equals one	
62:55		hundred nine point seven to eight feet	
62:57		inside B equals six hundred and seven	
63:00		one point forty two feet select an	
63:03		equation to fit the conditions in this	
63:05		case tangent a equals a divided by B	
63:09		please pause the tape at this point now	
63:13		plug the given quantities into the	
63:15		equation and perform the operation	
63:18		unpause the tape when you're finished we	
63:21		will compare answers okay you're back	
63:24		did you work the problem this way 109	
63:28		point 78 feet divided by 671 point 32	
63:32		feet equals arctangent 0.163 505 which	
63:38		equals nine degrees 17 minutes and 10	
63:41		seconds is this what you got the next	
63:46		example that we are going to work is	
63:48		solving for an unknown side application	
63:51		of the appropriate function from a given	
63:53		angle and side of our triangle and then	
63:56		computing the length of the missing side	
63:58		is the basic operation selection of the	
64:01		proper function to use is	
64:03		made easier if you make a quick sketch	
64:04		of the triangle showing given values and	
64:08		checking the relationship of the side	
64:09		side to these given values after	
64:12		choosing the best equation to use	
64:15		determine the mathematical correct	
64:17		numerical function for the given angle	
64:19		and then profound the appropriate math	
64:21		operations with the given sides selected	
64:24		to determine the missin value use 6	
64:27		decimal places for all the miracle trig	
64:29		functions that you use in the process	
64:31		then after your final answer to usually	
64:34		two decimal places let's try a missing	
64:37		side example as will be shown in the	
64:40		upcoming graphic we want to find side a	
64:42		information given is side B equals three	
64:46		hundred and twelve points up forty seven	
64:48		feet in angle a equals 21 degrees 37	
64:52		minutes and five seconds on your sketch	
64:56		note that only the given set the only	
64:59		given side is B and the only given angle	
65:01		is a that means your equation will have	
65:04		to be one that contains these elements	
65:06		for inspection of the equations it	
65:09		appears that the best trace would be	
65:11		side a equals side B times T ingenuity	
65:15		if you agree pause the tape now and	
65:19		complete your solution and then come	
65:20		back on to check my solution now that	
65:24		you're back	
65:25		let's review my solution three hundred	
65:27		and twelve point four seven side B times	
65:31		zero two point three nine six two nine	
65:33		three tangent a equals 123 point 83 feet	
65:39		this is the same thing that you came up	
65:41		with let's do one more solution before	
65:45		leaving this topic given side C equals	
65:48		six hundred and thirty six point O two	
65:50		feet in email a equals thirty four	
65:53		degrees	
65:54		fifty-six minutes and 35 seconds solve	
65:57		this triangle for side B after looking	
66:01		this stretch over I decided to leave the	
66:03		selection of a best equation to use for	
66:06		you one more time if you want to pause	
66:09		the tape and solve this example you have	
66:12		your	
66:13		so resume the tape and we can compare	
66:15		our notes I use side B in course side C	
66:20		times cosine a this reduces to 630 6.02	
66:25		fee times zero point seven or seven	
66:29		eight oh nine equals 550 point eighteen	
66:33		feet this time check your answer by the	
66:37		Pythagorean theorem by finding side a	
66:40		and then adding the squares of sides a	
66:42		and B for a check i computed side a as	
66:47		four hundred and forty nine point twenty	
66:49		nine feet this was the last of our like	
66:52		triangle problems not all triangles	
66:55		encountered in surveying or right	
66:57		triangles	
66:58		so let's now move on and take a look at	
67:00		dealing with oblique triangles and put	
67:02		more of our trigonometric scales to live	
67:05		as described earlier when a blue	
67:07		triangle is one that has no right angles	
67:10		in no sides equal to each other	
67:12		this makes the solution of obliques a	
67:15		bit more complex than the right triangle	
67:17		the available solutions for blue	
67:19		triangles can be grouped into four cases	
67:22		case number one given two eagles in the	
67:25		side opposite case number two given two	
67:29		sides and the included angle case number	
67:33		three given all three sides case number	
67:37		four given two sides in the opposite	
67:40		angle generally two formulas are used to	
67:44		solve oblique triangles the law of sines	
67:46		in the law of cosines the law of sines	
67:50		states that in any triangle the sides	
67:52		are proportional to the sine of the	
67:54		opposite angle the law of cosines states	
67:58		that in any triangle the square of any	
68:00		side is equal to the sum of the squares	
68:03		of the other two sides minus twice the	
68:06		product of those two sides multiplied by	
68:09		the cosine of their included angle the	
68:12		law of sines equation for oblique	
68:14		triangles is shown on the top part	
68:16		portion of this graphic as shown side a	
68:20		over sine a	
68:22		the same as side B over sine B equals	
68:27		side C over sine C equations based on	
68:31		the cosine law are also shown a squared	
68:34		equals B squared plus c squared minus	
68:37		bc times cosine a squared equals a	
68:44		squared plus c squared minus 2ac times	
68:48		cosine b sin squared equals a squared	
68:52		plus b squared minus 2a B times cosine C	
68:57		in the following discussion of solutions	
69:01		for oblique triangles only basic	
69:03		equations will be addressed the farmer	
69:06		took some of the cases most likely to	
69:08		occur in surveying you briefly explore	
69:10		the equation for them this graphic shows	
69:14		the configuration and notation for the	
69:16		oblique triangle solutions along with	
69:18		the first general equation we will be	
69:20		discussing when given angle a and angle	
69:23		B along the side a you can solve for the	
69:27		following angle C equals 180 degrees	
69:32		minus a plus b side b equals side a	
69:37		divided by sine a times sine b or side C	
69:43		equals side a divided by sine a times	
69:48		sine C the next solution occurs when	
69:55		angle a side B inside C are given as	
69:59		shown in this graphic the equation takes	
70:02		this form to solve for a a squared	
70:06		equals b squared plus c squared minus	
70:09		bc	
70:11		times cosine a the last general equation	
70:15		for blue triangles is for solving for	
70:19		angle a when only with three sides of	
70:22		the triangle given in this case knowing	
70:25		is forgiven but our three sides are the	
70:28		equation to solve for angle a	
70:32		is cosine a equals quantity B squared	
70:36		plus C squared minus a squared over to	
70:40		BC remember that all elements of an	
70:47		oblique triangle can be rotated around	
70:49		the triangle to fit given conditions as	
70:52		long as they are kept in the same order	
70:53		to each other angles and directions are	
70:58		a basic element of survey you should be	
71:00		familiar with the relationship of	
71:02		horizontal angles to the bearing and as	
71:04		in the systems of angular definition	
71:07		bearings are azimuth azimuth of survey	
71:10		lines must be referred to send their	
71:13		south meridian in order to maintain	
71:15		consistency in adherence to horizontal	
71:18		reference system a horizontal datum most	
71:22		horizontal systems are oriented to true	
71:25		north which is aligned on the surface of	
71:28		the earth that joins the North and South	
71:30		Poles however some systems are	
71:33		referenced to magnetic north	
71:36		a local assume north or whig north	
71:39		regardless of the system's origin	
71:41		bearings as honest and horizontal angles	
71:44		all relate to each other in the same	
71:46		manner in proportion for the purposes of	
71:50		discussion all direct calculations in	
71:52		this presentation are assumed to be	
71:55		referred to true or Geographic north	
71:58		let's first discuss the bearing system	
72:01		of Direction bearings our method of	
72:04		stating the direction of a survey line	
72:06		by indicating the angle of the line from	
72:08		its north-south meridian and also	
72:11		stating which quadrant the line falls in	
72:14		bearings are always measured to the east	
72:16		or west from the north-south Meridian	
72:18		line and their values are always need	
72:20		agrees or less fabric nook notation is	
72:24		indicated by N or s preceding a	
72:27		numerical value with E or W following	
72:30		you numbers for instance if the bearing	
72:33		of a line of a line was	
72:35		measured 36 degrees 45 minutes east of	
72:38		North its direction is written as north	
72:42		6 35 east the north and east	
72:47		designation is just as vital as the	
72:49		numerical value for bearings are shown	
72:53		in this sketch to each live in different	
72:56		quadrants and are identified as follows	
72:58		line Oh a equals north 36 degrees 45	
73:03		minutes east line OB equals South 20	
73:08		degrees 14 minutes east line Oh C equals	
73:13		South 46 11 minutes west line Oh D	
73:19		equals north 40 million degrees 37	
73:22		minutes west	
73:23		note that measurement of bearings in the	
73:26		northeast quadrant starts at north and	
73:29		rotates in a clockwise direction to the	
73:31		east while bearings in the northwest	
73:33		quadrant also started north they are	
73:36		measured in a counterclockwise rotation	
73:38		to the rest bearings in the southeast	
73:41		quadrant started south and are rotated	
73:44		in the counterclockwise direction to the	
73:46		east bearings in the southwest quadrant	
73:49		also started south and are measured in a	
73:51		clockwise rotation to the rest any	
73:55		survey line actually has two directions	
73:58		forward in the direction that a survey	
74:00		is progressing or back as in looking	
74:03		back to see where you have been	
74:05		normally bearing designation follows a	
74:09		consistent direction of travel around	
74:11		the figure for computational purposes it	
74:14		is often necessary to reverse the	
74:16		bearings easily done as shown in the	
74:20		sketch simply reverse the quadric	
74:22		designators to turn the bearing around	
74:24		by	
74:24		needy degrees in this line in this the	
74:28		line L - M has a third Bay of South 71	
74:33		over East reversing the bone the same	
74:37		line has a backbone of North 71 or 4	
74:41		rest when computing inverse from	
74:44		adjacent bearings the surveyor must	
74:46		routinely reverse bearings as	
74:48		computations proceed around and Alanna	
74:51		figure the azimuth system as a number is	
74:55		another method of measuring the angular	
74:58		dimension of a survey line azimuth	
75:02		measurement will originates at the north	
75:04		end of a Meridian 0 degrees and rotates	
75:07		in a clockwise direction all the way	
75:09		around the circle back to north again or	
75:12		60 degrees azimuth values fall in a	
75:16		range from 0 degrees to 360 degrees	
75:20		in this sketch the line into s is the	
75:24		meridian line o2a has an azimuth of 44	
75:29		degrees line o to be has an azimuth of	
75:33		35 degrees line o to C has azimuth of	
75:38		58 degrees in line o to D has an	
75:42		azimuth 335 degrees as in the bearing	
75:47		system every survey line has two azimuth	
75:50		a forward azimuth and O back or reverse	
75:53		azimuth when the azimuth of a line is	
75:57		designated it is assumed that the	
75:59		angular value of a line is from the	
76:01		beginning of the line as one faces the	
76:03		endpoint of the line frequently for	
76:07		computational purposes the surveyor must	
76:10		determine back azimuth of lines again	
76:13		very simply done just add or subtract	
76:17		80 degrees from the floor as enough of	
76:19		a line in the graphic now on screen the	
76:23		farad azimuth of line D to e is 49	
76:25		degree	
76:26		in minutes based on the angle measured	
76:28		from north and the direction of travel	
76:31		reversing the direction of travel	
76:33		adding 180 degrees determines the back	
76:37		azimuth of the same line as 229 degrees	
76:41		1 minutes in review bearings are	
76:45		reversed by switching the letters of	
76:47		quadrants azimuth are reversed by adding	
76:50		or subtracting 180 degrees since they	
76:54		both originate at the same point	
76:55		bearings and azimuth sorry zhilie	
76:58		interchanged azimuth directions are more	
77:01		convenient for computing directions and	
77:03		angles while most maps in survey	
77:05		tradition dictate the use of bearings	
77:08		therefore surveyors should be ready to	
77:10		make azimuth bearing conversions let's	
77:13		take a look at the next graphic well I	
77:15		discussed this process a little further	
77:17		this graphic shows the angular	
77:20		relationship of azimuth to bearings in	
77:22		each of the four quadrants for instance	
77:25		look at the northeast quadrant lion-o a	
77:28		has a bearing of North 83 degrees o	
77:31		seven minutes east	
77:33		since azimuth and vary both started	
77:36		north and rotate clockwise they will be	
77:38		identical in this quadrant next we go to	
77:41		the southeast quadrant and take a look	
77:43		at line OB	
77:44		its bearing is south 33 11 east remember	
77:49		south east bearings originate from south	
77:52		and rotate counterclockwise while	
77:54		azimuth rotate clockwise an angle from	
77:57		north around the south is 180 degrees	
78:01		therefore subtract the south east	
78:03		bearing from 180 which equals 156 39	
78:09		diaz Ameth applying OB in the southwest	
78:14		quadrant	
78:15		just to add 180 degrees to the bearing	
78:17		value to obtain azimuth or subtract 180	
78:21		degrees from the azimuth value to obtain	
78:23		the value of a Southwest bearing this	
78:26		should be routine by now so most of you	
78:28		have already figured out	
78:30		that you subtract a Northwest bearing in	
78:32		60 degrees to obtain asthma or subtract	
78:36		as enough from 360 degrees to obtain the	
78:39		value of the Northwest bearing in review	
78:43		to do bearing two azimuth the conversion	
78:46		if it is a northeast bearing it is the	
78:49		same as azimuth considering a southeast	
78:52		very subtract bearing from 180 degrees	
78:55		to find azimuth considering the	
78:58		southwest bearing at 180 degrees to	
79:01		Barry to get to asthma considering a	
79:04		Northwest bearing subtract bearing from	
79:07		60 degrees to get azimuth to do an	
79:11		azimuth to burying conversion if it's in	
79:14		northeast azimuth is the same as the	
79:17		Northeast bearing if it's in the	
79:20		southeast quadrant subtract as a month	
79:22		from 180 degrees to get a southeast	
79:25		bearing if any southwest quadrant add	
79:28		80 degrees to bearing to get to azimuth	
79:32		if it's in a Northwest bearing subtract	
79:35		azimuth from 360 degrees to get	
79:38		Northwest bearing most surveyors require	
79:42		that surveyors compute English from sets	
79:45		of grid and bearings or determining goes	
79:48		from horizontal angles or combining both	
79:50		operations in the course of computing	
79:52		let's take another look at this next	
79:55		graphic and let's explore the process	
79:58		given a bearing and include an angle to	
80:00		a second survey line determine the	
80:03		bearing of the second line at this point	
80:05		let me express how importantly sketch is	
80:08		to the eagle and burn calculation	
80:10		process it is it almost makes the	
80:14		problem assess it makes the problem	
80:16		solving if you draw a sketch that the	
80:19		one on screen notice that all data is	
80:22		shown on the sketch alone with an X for	
80:24		the missing value in this case the	
80:26		bearing angle for	
80:27		Oh to Jay from inspection of a sketch x	
80:31		equals the very angle of 9oj therefore x	
80:36		equals 103 degrees 31 minutes minus 58	
80:41		degrees 39 minutes equals 35 degrees 52	
80:45		minutes or north 34 degrees 52 minutes	
80:49		west	
80:49		in this graphic the example presented	
80:53		and sketched is finding the included	
80:56		angle X between lines A to C north 31 36	
81:01		rest and Oh to a South 56:11 West with	
81:07		the problem over then pause the tape	
81:09		solve the problem and then get back on	
81:12		the tape as we will compare answers okay	
81:16		this is what I did and this is the	
81:18		answer I got x equals 180 degrees minus	
81:23		6 degrees 11 minutes plus 31 degrees 36	
81:27		minutes which equals 92 degrees 13	
81:31		minutes how did you do with this one	
81:34		like I said earlier one sketch is worth	
81:37		a lot of work this graphic shows the	
81:41		last of the bearing angle examples in is	
81:44		an azimuth question but in the sketch	
81:46		that we are looking for X the included	
81:48		angle between the two eyes of us once	
81:51		again pause the tape solve for X and get	
81:54		back to me with an answer	
81:56		welcome back I found by using my sketch	
81:59		and the information plotted on it that x	
82:01		equals 135 degrees 35 minutes how did I	
82:05		with this answer by subtracting 146	
82:09		degrees 11 minutes from 281 degrees 46	
82:12		minutes you will be confronted with an	
82:17		almost limitless number of angle bearing	
82:20		azimuth problems on a daily basis any	
82:23		test you take is assuredly going to have	
82:26		this type problem in it however if you	
82:29		draw a sketch the correct position of	
82:32		all lines in all the knowns and unknowns	
82:34		any angle barring azimuth problem can be	
82:37		almost self-solving points located by	
82:42		surveys are referenced to a known point	
82:45		in one of two ways by polar relocation	
82:48		or by rectangular court by rectangular	
82:51		location header location ties a found	
82:55		point to a known reference location by a	
82:58		bearing and distance measurement as	
83:00		shown in this graphic note that point L	
83:03		is referenced to point K by a line of	
83:06		north 76 degrees 23 minutes east 611	
83:11		point 21 feet rectangular location ties	
83:16		a found point to a known location by two	
83:18		distances that are perpendicular to each	
83:21		other and usually aligned north and east	
83:23		as shown in this graphic note the	
83:26		printer L is referenced to point K by ad	
83:29		parallel easting the 594 from both three	
83:32		feet in a nerving or latitude of 143	
83:36		point 89 feet nor these and eastings are	
83:39		also called Delta Y and Delta X	
83:41		respectively Y and X are the standard	
83:44		designators for north and east distances	
83:47		in our terminal metric calculation	
83:49		procedures after looking at the two	
83:52		preceding graphics we can see that a	
83:54		player measurement bearing and distance	
83:56		in a rectangular measurement Delta Y and	
83:59		Delta X are functions of each other in	
84:02		fact it can be said that every line	
84:04		measured by bearing in distance also has	
84:07		a corresponding Delta X Delta Y and	
84:10		Delta X which can also be called	
84:13		latitude and departure as shown in this	
84:16		graphic the latitude is a distance	
84:18		measured in north-south direction while	
84:21		departures are measured in the east-west	
84:23		dimension latitudes are positive value	
84:26		when measured to the north	
84:28		measured south likewise departures are	
84:32		positive and measure to the east and	
84:34		negative are measured to the west	
84:36		therefore when computing latitudes and	
84:38		departures remember to assign the proper	
84:40		algebraic sign to these to distinguish	
84:43		which quadrant they fall into after	
84:46		living with the last couple of graphics	
84:48		it is evident that the player or bearing	
84:51		and distance dimension in the latitude	
84:53		in departure dimension when superimposed	
84:55		formulate triangle this is what	
84:59		calculation and latitudes and departures	
85:01		from a survey learning is based on the	
85:03		process is almost identical to right	
85:05		triangle formulas almost identical	
85:08		because instead of dealing with angle a	
85:11		as we did earlier in the video we are	
85:13		now going to use the bearing or azimuth	
85:15		angle instead do not confuse the two in	
85:19		your computing process because the	
85:21		latitude and departure will be reversed	
85:24		if angle a is used to calculate a	
85:27		latitude of departure of the survey	
85:29		course simply multiply the length of the	
85:31		course by the cosine of the bearing or	
85:34		azimuth to determine latitude multiply	
85:37		length by the sine of the bearing or	
85:39		azimuth to find that aperture this	
85:42		graphic shows the equation format for	
85:45		latitude and aperture computations	
85:47		when using bearings it is necessary to	
85:50		select and assign the proper algebraic	
85:52		sign to the latitudes and the poachers	
85:54		when using azimuth the adverb lyric	
85:57		signs of the sine cosine functions will	
86:00		produce the correct algebraic signs for	
86:02		the computed latitudes and departures	
86:05		let's try a determination of latitude	
86:08		and departure is shown in the sketch	
86:10		first find sine and cosine of the	
86:13		bearing sine equals zero point 8 4 9 to	
86:18		/8 and cosine equals 0.5 to a row 4	
86:23		three then multiply the length 549 point	
86:27		1 feet are the functions the sequence a	
86:31		latitude of +2 9 0.32 feet in the	
86:36		departure of plus four hundred sixty six	
86:38		point nine you run feet because it is a	
86:42		northeast bearing both latitude and	
86:44		departure would have positive signs	
86:46		let's try the one shown in this sketch	
86:49		the course bearing is south 36 degrees	
86:53		1 minutes 57 seconds rest in distance	
86:57		is 576 point 33 feet what is the	
87:01		latitude and departure stop the tape	
87:04		calculate the values and then get back	
87:06		to me hello again if you did the same	
87:11		work idea we would have gotten a lotta	
87:13		tude negative three hundred and ninety	
87:16		eight point 91 feet any departure of	
87:19		negative 451 point ninety seven feet	
87:22		note that both values are negative since	
87:25		the course lies in the southwesterly	
87:27		direction the éclairs travelers survey	
87:31		begins and ends at the same point	
87:33		forming a geometric polygon	
87:36		therefore when algebraically summarized	
87:38		the latitudes and departures should	
87:41		cancel each other out both sounds	
87:44		algebraically total totalling to zero	
87:46		for the followers this graphic shows a	
87:49		summary table for the travelers note the	
87:52		algebraic signs and the totals would	
87:54		indicate miss Clara here as I mentioned	
87:57		earlier the terrorists should always be	
87:59		zero but really are due to the random	
88:02		they are always present in any and all	
88:04		survey measurements	
88:05		remember this graphic and compare it to	
88:08		the next one which is a sketch of a	
88:09		traverse with the latitudes and	
88:12		departures shown plotted around the	
88:14		course on this sketch notice the	
88:18		Traverse forming a closed five sided	
88:22		polygon that should but really will ever	
88:24		close perfectly note how the latitudes	
88:27		and departures show around the track	
88:29		appear to form rectangle after they were	
88:32		algebraically summarized as shown in the	
88:35		last graphic the area of closure is	
88:37		defined the process of travellish	
88:40		closure and adjustment and also the	
88:42		computation of area by double reading	
88:44		distance method would be fully addressed	
88:47		later in another room of the series of	
88:49		videos when the latitude and departure	
88:53		between two unconnected survey points	
88:55		are known they can be used to determine	
88:58		the unknown vary in distance between the	
89:00		points this operation is called the	
89:03		inverse process and is based on the	
89:06		formulas shown in the next graphic note	
89:09		that in the inverse process latitude and	
89:12		departure will be called that's arrive	
89:14		for latitude Delta X for the poacher the	
89:18		equations shown are used to determine	
89:20		the bearing in wisdom's of the missing	
89:22		course first the bearing a be tangent	
89:26		bearing or azimuth a B equals Delta X a	
89:33		B divided by Delta Y a be the distance	
89:37		ay B is determined by the second	
89:40		equation distance ay B equals Delta X a	
89:44		B divided by sine of bearing a B the	
89:49		results of the computation can be	
89:51		checked by application of the	
89:52		Pythagorean theorem distance ay B equals	
89:56		the square root of Delta Y a B squared	
90:02		plus Delta X a B squared	
90:06		before leaving latitudes and departures	
90:09		or Delta Y and Delta X as I like to call	
90:12		them let's do an inverse problem from	
90:15		the data shown on this graphic we want	
90:17		to solve for the missing information for	
90:20		line r2s to calculate the azimuth in	
90:23		line length of line RS use Delta y	
90:28		equals minus 1536 point 11 feet in Delta	
90:34		x equals 1400	
90:36		18 feet therefore 1400 21.18 feet	
90:43		divided by negative 1536 point 11 feet	
90:48		equals arctangent 0.98 9 6 over 4 equals	
90:54		34 degrees from two minutes and two	
90:58		seconds azimuth 100 1421 point 18 feet	
91:05		divided by the sine of the bearing sign	
91:10		is zero point seven oh three for two	
91:13		equals 2020 point forty four feet check	
91:19		is the square root of negative one	
91:22		thousand four hundred and thirty-six	
91:24		point eleven squared plus one thousand	
91:29		four hundred twenty-one point eighty	
91:31		feet squared equals two thousand twenty	
91:34		point forty four feet	
91:35		problem solved and proven now let's move	
91:39		on to converting that to rise and Delta	
91:43		X's in two plane coordinates rectangular	
91:46		coordinates locate the positions of	
91:48		survey stations onto a perpendicular	
91:51		reference system having a single point	
91:53		of origin this type of system is based	
91:56		on a pair of axes at right angles to	
91:59		each other on this sketch the line	
92:02		labeled x-axis runs in an east-west	
92:04		direction distances measured in the	
92:07		easterly direction will have positive	
92:09		values the y axis runs north-south and	
92:12		distances measured from south to north	
92:14		will have a plus value notice that the	
92:17		point of origin has a coordinate value	
92:19		of zero zero the point of origin of our	
92:22		systems should be located far enough to	
92:24		the west and south and assign this value	
92:27		this assures that all points in the	
92:30		system will be located in the northeast	
92:32		quadrant of the system and have positive	
92:34		coordinate values coordinate systems may	
92:37		be a simple plane system such as we will	
92:39		be discussing for the next few minutes	
92:41		there can be a very complex statewide	
92:44		system such as the California	
92:46		coordinates	
92:47		of 1983 that will be discussed in the	
92:50		later video unit this graphic is	
92:53		included to illustrate how coordinate	
92:55		values for individual survey points are	
92:58		located let's take a look at Point Q	
93:01		notice that it is located 75 feet north	
93:04		in 55 foot east of the origin therefore	
93:08		its coordinate value or address will be	
93:11		y equals 75 feet and x equals 55 feet	
93:15		moving on up to the next point R we see	
93:18		that it's Delta Y is 173 point over 4	
93:22		feet and Delta X is 154 point 56 feet	
93:26		it's coordinates will be y equals one	
93:30		hundred and seventy three point oh four	
93:31		feet and x equals one hundred and fifty	
93:34		four point 56 feet now on the move of	
93:37		northeasterly two point s we find with a	
93:40		Probab a delta y of eighty three point	
93:43		oh eight feet and a delta X of 135 from	
93:47		eleven feet from Pulgar adding these	
93:50		doubts as to the coordinates for point R	
93:51		we determine that point s will have	
93:54		coordinates of y equals 256 point twelve	
93:57		feet and x equals 289 point sixty seven	
94:01		feet while we are still looking at this	
94:04		sketch also notice the relationship of	
94:06		all points in the system to the origin	
94:08		and the relationship of each point on	
94:10		the system to any other point for	
94:13		instance a quick bit of simple math	
94:15		tells us that r is located menu 8.0 four	
94:19		feet north in 99 point 56 feet east of Q	
94:23		by rectangular location	
94:25		sommore quick math assert us us that R	
94:28		is also located north 35 degrees 26	
94:32		minutes 26 seconds east one hundred and	
94:35		thirty nine point eighty feet from Q	
94:37		bi-polar location let's leave this	
94:40		graphic and discuss this quick math in a	
94:42		little more detail in a bit coordinates	
94:45		for survey points are computed by	
94:47		algebraically adding the Delta Y and	
94:50		Delta X of each	
94:52		seceding course to the coordinate value	
94:55		of the starting point or the point of	
94:57		beginning of the survey this graphic	
95:00		illustrates the equations use to	
95:02		calculate coordinates of survey points	
95:04		starting from the coordinated survey	
95:06		station assume a coordinate is given for	
95:09		station R and given Delta Y Delta X	
95:13		you're asked to determine coordinates	
95:15		for station s the equations for	
95:18		computing coordinates for station s our	
95:21		Y of s equals y of R plus Delta Y RS x	
95:29		of s equals x and r plus Delta X of RS	
95:35		this next graphic presents an	
95:38		application of equations we had just	
95:40		looked at a short while back in the	
95:42		presentation I showed you a graphic of	
95:45		latitudes in the Parcher tabulation that	
95:47		did not close very well well between the	
95:50		scenes I adjusted the miss closure out	
95:53		of the figure by a method you will share	
95:55		in one of the later videos of the series	
95:57		in the graphic now on screen notice the	
96:01		Delta Y a be 270 point 17 has been added	
96:05		to the starting y-coordinate for station	
96:08		a 6000 feet making a y-coordinate for	
96:11		station B 6270 point 17 feet the	
96:17		x-coordinate for station B is found by	
96:19		adding Delta X a be sixty four point	
96:23		ninety six feet to the starting	
96:25		x-coordinate for station a the	
96:28		x-coordinate for B is two thousand sixty	
96:31		four point ninety six feet the next step	
96:34		is to determine coordinates of Point C	
96:37		by adding vector Y BC negative 68 point	
96:42		ninety seven feet to the y coordinate	
96:45		for station B 6270 point seventeen feed	
96:49		the right coordinate station y	
96:51		coordinate for station c is found to be	
96:54		six thousand two hundred and one point	
96:56		twenty feet the x coordinate for station	
96:59		c is	
97:00		found by adding Delta X BC 197 point 97	
97:06		feet to the x-coordinate for station B	
97:09		the x-coordinate for C is calculated at	
97:12		two thousand three hundred and sixty two	
97:14		point ninety three feet repeating this	
97:17		operation the remaining way around the	
97:19		travelers we closed back into a the	
97:23		starting point with a perfect closure	
97:26		the equations just discussed very	
97:29		appealing in a slightly different form	
97:31		are identical with those used to	
97:33		determine polar dimensions that we	
97:35		discussed in detail and the latitudes in	
97:37		departure section in this video I will	
97:39		then finding Delta Y and Delta X by	
97:42		subtracting the respective coordinates	
97:43		the math is the same therefore I will	
97:46		not present any practice problems for	
97:48		this operation	
97:49		rest assured though that this operation	
97:52		will be covered in the workbook problems	
97:55		most of today's surveys are placed on or	
97:59		reference to either a state plane	
98:01		coordinate system or a local arbitrary	
98:03		system locating survey points on a	
98:06		coordinate system have these distinct	
98:09		advantages location of all points are	
98:11		uniquely defined both on the ground and	
98:14		to each other	
98:15		the survey can easily be plotted in math	
98:19		last or destroyed points can be easily	
98:21		replaced data storage and retrieval is	
98:25		much more efficient and survey	
98:27		computations are greatly simplified in	
98:31		this section I will extend the use of	
98:33		coordinates to find intersection points	
98:35		of two straight lines intersection	
98:38		points of a straight line in an arc in	
98:40		intersection points of two arcs these	
98:44		type of situations are solved through	
98:46		the use of coordinate geometry which is	
98:48		rooted in emetic geometry this section	
98:52		of the math video describes some of the	
98:54		basics of coordinate geometry along with	
98:57		some calculation examples I do not	
99:00		intend to thoroughly explain coordinate	
99:02		geometry	
99:03		I only wish to familiar familiarize the	
99:05		viewer with the operations in software	
99:08		that was now being used to solve	
99:10		problems by coordinate geometry the	
99:13		coordinate geometry equations for	
99:15		solution of missing elements are a	
99:17		little too complex to include on this	
99:19		video you should however that there are	
99:22		sufficiently addressed in the workbook	
99:25		the first in a series of intersection	
99:27		problems in virus finding the location	
99:30		where lines AC and BD intersect is shown	
99:35		in the upcoming graphics ideally the	
99:39		answers we are looking for are the	
99:42		coordinate value of station e the	
99:45		distance of line AE and the distance	
99:48		applying be e the given values that we	
99:51		work that we will work with as shown in	
99:54		the graphic are coordinates of point a	
99:58		coordinates of point B the bearing of	
100:01		void AE and the bearing of line B e the	
100:06		first step to take in the solution is to	
100:08		examine the given data to see which case	
100:10		the solution will fit into although we	
100:13		have already identified this as a very	
100:15		buried case let's look at the Givens we	
100:19		have a burden for both lines a to e in B	
100:22		to e in Canyon verse between a and B to	
100:25		find over a base for the blue training a	
100:28		solution or into the coordinates into a	
100:30		computer program to the burden bearing	
100:32		solution in a typical program computer	
100:36		solution coordinate values for a and B	
100:39		are into the RAM with the bearing avoids	
100:41		a2 e in B to e the computer ribbon	
100:45		process the data using the coordinate	
100:47		geometry equations and give the	
100:50		coordinate value of Punky along with the	
100:53		distance of lines AE in be e to use the	
100:58		oblique triangle solution after in	
101:00		nursing it is then necessary to	
101:02		determine all angles in the triangle	
101:05		women bearings in the 1 computed use the	
101:08		distance competed from the inverse as	
101:10		the base point angle-angle-side solution	
101:14		the answers is shown on this graphic are	
101:17		the quadrant value of Station e is why	
101:22		52 point 35 X 1240 point 83 feet the	
101:30		distance of luring AE is 400 in 1551	
101:35		feet the distance of line be e is 477	
101:40		point 76 feet next in the intersection	
101:44		of straight-line series is finding	
101:47		location where lines k2 m and L 2 n	
101:51		intersect as shown on this next graphic	
101:54		again the answers we are looking for	
101:57		include the coordinate value of station	
102:00		o the bearing of line AE and the	
102:03		distance of line b ET the given values	
102:07		we will work with as shown on the	
102:09		graphic our coordinates of point IAM	
102:11		coordinates of point k distance of line	
102:15		k2 l burying of loin in tow	
102:18		let's examine the given data to see what	
102:20		case the solution will fit into from	
102:23		living with the given values we have a	
102:25		bearing for learning into own in a	
102:28		distance for Cato and can invest between	
102:31		in and K to find either a base from the	
102:34		blue triangle solution or enter the	
102:36		coordinates of KL in a computer program	
102:39		for a bearing distance solution in the	
102:42		typical program of computer solution	
102:44		quadrant values for N and K are entered	
102:46		along with the bearing of lines in O in	
102:49		the distance of 9ko	
102:52		the computer event processed the data	
102:54		using the coordinate geometry equations	
102:57		the coordinate value of point O and the	
103:00		distance for line in	
103:01		along with the bearing of line Kol will	
103:04		be displayed or put them with the proper	
103:05		storage registers this time in using the	
103:09		oblique triangle for a solution after	
103:11		embossing it was a little more involved	
103:12		as it is necessary to first determine	
103:15		the interior angle at all this however	
103:18		will complete all angles in the triangle	
103:20		leading to an angle angle side solution	
103:24		the answers for the bearing distance	
103:27		problem are as shown on the screen	
103:29		the quadrant value of station all is yy6	
103:35		over nine point eighty seven feet x six	
103:38		ninety five point 75 feet the distance	
103:42		of line in O is four hundred ninety six	
103:45		point twenty three feet the bearing of	
103:47		Lorene KL is north twenty five degrees	
103:51		6 minutes for four seconds East the	
103:56		last of the intersection of	
103:57		straight-line series is to determine	
103:59		where the lines TV in WV intersect is	
104:04		shown in this next graphic this time the	
104:07		answer is being sought are the	
104:10		coordinate value of x the value that	
104:13		bearing of line X to V and the bearing	
104:16		of line X to you the given values that	
104:19		we that we will work with this time are	
104:22		shown in the graphic as coordinates of	
104:24		point new coordinates of point new	
104:27		distance of line V 2 X distance of lying	
104:31		you to X let's look at what is given to	
104:35		decide which case this solution will fit	
104:37		into from looking at the given values we	
104:40		find that we have distances for both	
104:42		line v 2x and lying u 2x we can then	
104:47		inverse between V and u to find either a	
104:50		base for an oblique triangle solution or	
104:53		us into the coordinates of the	
104:55		you very computer to solve this distance	
104:58		distance problem for the computer	
105:00		solution coordinate values for V and u	
105:03		are entered along with the distance	
105:05		distances of nines v 2x in u 2x the	
105:09		computer will then process the data	
105:11		using the coordinate geometry equation	
105:14		for a distance distance solution	
105:16		displaying the coordinate value of point	
105:19		X and the bearings for lines v 2x in u	
105:22		x the oblique triangle solution for	
105:26		this problem will be based on the case	
105:28		for three ribbon sides and can be solved	
105:32		with a variation of the distance	
105:33		distance solution the answers for the	
105:37		distance distance problem are as shown	
105:39		in this screen the coordinate value of	
105:41		Station X is y 1650 2.57 in x 1733 point	
105:50		5 the bearing of marine v 2x is south	
105:54		6 21 28 west the bearing of learning	
105:59		new 2x is north 79o 330 east the three	
106:08		preceding intersection solutions have	
106:11		addressed all the cases possible with	
106:13		straight line solutions I must caution	
106:16		you that in the distance distance case	
106:18		there are two solutions to the problem	
106:21		that are equally correct be sure that	
106:24		you always draw a fairly accurate sketch	
106:26		to guide you in choice of the solution	
106:29		to fit your needs to other intersection	
106:32		situations intersection of a straight	
106:34		line and arc and intersection of two	
106:37		arcs have not been addressed in this	
106:39		discussion solutions for these two cases	
106:43		are based on the same geometry and	
106:45		selection of formulas used for straight	
106:47		line intersection problems the viewer	
106:50		needs only to draw a sketch of the	
106:52		problem and the choice of solution	
106:54		should become quite clear the discussion	
106:58		of intersection problems has brought us	
107:00		to the	
107:01		this video presentation thank you for	
107:04		your attention throughout this long	
107:05		session I sincerely hope that I was able	
107:08		to make basic surveying math a little	
107:11		less formidable and a little more	
107:13		friendlier if nothing else I offer you	
107:16		this advice always always always draw	
107:20		sketch keep your calculations as simple	
107:23		as possible and be neat in meticulous in	
107:26		your notes good luck with your surveying	
107:29		career in general and with the land	
107:31		surveyors examinations processes in	
107:34		particular	
108:19		you
