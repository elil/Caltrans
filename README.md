This is a supplement to the Caltrans LS & LSIT Workbook and Videos, http://www.dot.ca.gov/landsurveys/workbook.html.  Credit for this incredible resource goes to Caltrans which lists acknowledgements here, http://www.dot.ca.gov/landsurveys/docs/lsit-workbook/001.pdf

The purpose of this repo is to provide timestamped transcritps to the videos.  Being able to search the text makes it easier to review specific sections.  The content comes from the https://www.youtube.com/user/PublicResourceOrg/about video postings which are listed as public domain.  

Pull requests welcome for what must surely be innumerable automated transcription errors and some light regular expression processing.
