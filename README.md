The initial purpose of this repo is to provide timestamped transcripts to the videos.  Being able to search the text makes it easier to review specific sections.  The content comes from the https://www.youtube.com/user/PublicResourceOrg/about video postings.  

Pull requests welcome for what must surely be innumerable automated transcription errors and some light regular expression processing.  

This can also be a place to collect errata, notes, and commentary.  

Now that the Caltrans site is no longer available, the expanded purpose of this repo beyond timestamped transcripts to the videos is to provide an index to the material.
